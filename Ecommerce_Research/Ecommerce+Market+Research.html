<h1 id="I.-Objective">I. Objective<a class="anchor-link" href="#I.-Objective">&#182;</a></h1><p>What is the Problem You Are Attempting to Solve?
    With the internet becoming increasingly involved in the average person’s daily life, many companies have taken to ecommerce, which is the electronic sale of goods through the internet. For an entrepreneur to break into the ecommerce market or for a large company to add their sources of revenue, a niche market must be found.
    For the sake of clarity in this project, a niche market will be defined using this Wikipedia description:
A niche market is the subset of the market on which a specific product is focused. The market niche defines as the product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs, as well as the price range, production quality, and the demographics that is intended to impact.
The niche market is highly specialized, and aiming to survive among the competition from numerous super companies. Even established companies create products for different niches, for example, Hewlett-Packard has all-in-one machines for printing, scanning, and faxing targeted for the home office niche while at the same time having separate machines with one of these functions for big businesses.
With this definition in mind, the problem will be defined as, “With competition saturating the ecommerce market, what is the best niche market for a business or entrepreneur to expand into?”
    To narrow the scope of this project, the focus will be on electronics appliances. 
How is Your Solution Valuable?
The result of this project will be a solution that exceeds the performance of other niche market research tools in terms of finding the ideal niche market in a given sector. The ideal niche market is one that has some or all of the following criteria:
•   high search volume
•   products that are difficult for consumers to find locally
•   solves a common problem
•   has a customer base that is passionate
•   is not overrun with websites that have a Google PageRank of five or higher
•   has accessible suppliers.
o   Google PageRank is explained in the Appendix
The solution will drastically reduce the number of hours and amount of wages spent for market research and will be a valuable tool for anyone in ecommerce, from large companies to individual entrepreneurs</p>

<h3 id="What-Techniques-From-the-Course-Do-You-Anticipate-Using?">What Techniques From the Course Do You Anticipate Using?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-Techniques-From-the-Course-Do-You-Anticipate-Using?">&#182;</a></h3><p>The project will begin with a broad search of keywords related to technology appliances on Keyword Planner (see appendix for description). For example, a keyword search was conducted for "Consumer Electronics Appliances" that returned seven hundred keywords with information on their average monthly searches and their level of competition (Low, Medium, or High). This information will be downloaded and filtered to generate a list of keywords that have a high number of average monthly searches and a low rank of competition. Keyword Planner measures competition by evaluating the number of advertisers that showed on each keyword relative to all keywords across Google.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook will then be scraped to gather posts that reference the products in the keyword list. With this data, an Unsupervised Neural Network will perform Natural Language Processing to generate sentiment analysis of the products.</p>
<p>The combined data from all techniques will be used as the features for a 
Supervised Neural Network that will predict the rise in popularity of a product over a six month period.
The predictions will be evaluated against the rise in popularity of the product(s) via Google Trends results.</p>

<h2 id="Keyword-Planning-Results">Keyword Planning Results<a class="anchor-link" href="#Keyword-Planning-Results">&#182;</a></h2><p>The Keyword Planner returned over seven hundred keywords under "Consumer Electronics." The keywords were filtered to a list that had Average Monthly Searches between ten thousand and one hundred thousand and a Competition value under .70. The resulting list contained forty-eight keywords. After ruling out any brand names and similar keywords, this project will proceed with three of the items: Walkie Talkies, Radar Detectors, and Car Audio systems. An AliExpress search was conducted to verify the existence of manufacturers that were in a tolerable price range and able to ship one-piece orders. The tolerable price range was as follows: Walkie Talkies &lt; \$25, Radar Detectors &lt; \$15, and Car Audio &lt; \$45.</p>

<span class="c1"># In line two, we add an Embedding layer. This layer lets the network expand each token to a larger vector, allowing the network to represent words in a meaningful way. We pass 20000 as the first argument, which is the size of our vocabulary (remember, we told the tokenizer to only use the 20 000 most common words earlier), and 128 as the second, which means that each token can be expanded to a vector of size 128. We give it an input_length of 300, which is the length of each of our sequences.</span>

<pre>[&#39;__label__2 Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I\&#39;m in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life\&#39;s hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing &#34;Who was that singing ?&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;__label__2 One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn&#39;t really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there&#39;s not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren&#39;t included I would still consider the collection worth it.&#34;]</pre>

<pre>[&#39;Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I\&#39;m in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life\&#39;s hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing &#34;Who was that singing ?&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn&#39;t really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there&#39;s not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren&#39;t included I would still consider the collection worth it.&#34;,
 &#39;Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.&#39;,
 &#34;works fine, but Maha Energy is better: Check out Maha Energy&#39;s website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.&#34;,
 &#34;Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don&#39;t want to replace them with DVD&#39;s. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.&#34;,
 &#34;DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I&#39;ve read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that&#39;s a sign on bad quality. I&#39;m giving up JVC after this as well. I&#39;m sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.&#34;,
 &#34;Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn&#39;t even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this, I&#39;m just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i&#39;m giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.&#34;,
 &#34;DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD&#39;s besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.&#34;,
 &#39;Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930\&#39;s: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930\&#39;s. &#34;Dr Shen Fu&#34;, a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you\&#39;re tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen\&#39;s palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.&#39;,
 &#39;Not an &#34;ultimate guide&#34;: Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.&#39;,
 &#39;Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go, and once you are there.&#39;,
 &#39;Not!: If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.&#39;,
 &#39;A complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I\&#39;ve been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my &#34;operating system limitations&#34;. This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.&#39;,
 &#39;TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.&#39;,
 &#34;didn&#39;t run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy!: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don&#39;t actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won&#39;t work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can&#39;t actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don&#39;t waste your money!&#34;,
 &#34;Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can&#39;t play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it&#39;s not as easy as it looks when you&#39;re stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I&#39;m trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.&#34;,
 &#34;Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one&#39;s very own parade.&#34;,
 &#39;SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX: Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas, lo puedes usar como obra de consultaNos trae LAS HISTORIA DE LOS BOXEADORES MÁS BRILLANTES, DE LOS CAMPEONES DURANTE CIEN AÑOS !!Si te gusta el box...¡NO TE LO PIERDAS !&#39;,
 &#39;Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time: This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.&#39;,
 &#34;Long and boring: I&#39;ve read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all through out the book&#34;,
 &#39;Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.&#39;,
 &#39;one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day&#39;,
 &#39;Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.&#34;,
 &#39;Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 &amp; 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done.&#39;,
 &#34;works great: i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed, but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this. just too many variables. I can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage; at least 40&#39; going thru two buildings. now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know.&#34;,
 &#34;Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I&#39;d recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.&#34;,
 &#39;wish i had gotten this sooner!: ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk, shelf, etc.&#39;,
 &#39;Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction.&#39;,
 &#39;This is the all time best book!: This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world.&#39;,
 &#34;Mary Ash: Can&#39;t believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.&#34;,
 &#34;Tha BOMB of a book!!: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can&#39;t stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn&#39;t. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you&#39;ll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!&#34;,
 &#39;This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story because I want to know if Mary-Lynette and Ash get together.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;d watch it nonstop if I&#39;d let them: apart from it arriving broken the first time, my kids are loving this DVD, which I alternate with the other I purchased to keep my own sanity. This DVD has created a Thomas fan out of my 3 1/2 yr. old daughter as well.&#34;,
 &#34;Not as expected...: My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn&#39;t keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!&#34;,
 &#39;Wonderful: I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.&#39;,
 &#39;Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again.&#39;,
 &#34;Book of Chance: I had just finished reading &#39;The Food of Love&#39; by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that &#39;three for the price of two&#39; deal at Waterstones in London (British&#39;s equivalent of Barnes&amp;Noble;). I wasn&#39;t really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I&#39;m glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven&#39;t put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it&#39;s an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I&#39;m sure you would not be disappointed.&#34;,
 &#34;Light reading, light in substance: A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she&#39;s studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno&#39;s cooking with a passion. That&#39;s about it. And Tomasso, he&#39;s just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It&#39;s a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author&#39;s more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.&#34;,
 &#39;WeiB FOREVER!: This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop, but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that &#34;hunt the tomorrow&#34; of Bad guys, the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see...&#39;,
 &#34;Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine&#39;s restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund.&#34;,
 &#34;Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I&#39;ve ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I&#39;d buy that right away.&#34;,
 &#34;Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don&#39;t let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style &amp; Pop Rock mix), plus it&#39;s worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts. It ends the way a typical relationship of this type would, but that&#39;s not exactly a bad thing in this case. I recommend it to everyone.&#34;,
 &#34;Amazing...: love it...very touch.it&#39;s to bad that in the dvd description doesn&#39;t mention no subtitles&#34;,
 &#34;Leslie in a nutshell: Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal, is an amazing little pedal!I use it with guitar, and keyboards.Using with Keyboards, organ mode(doesn&#39;t matter which type) jazz, rock, gives me an instant controllable Leslie effects.it includes fast and slow ramp up,boost, volume/drive. thru a mixer in stereo you can do some amazing stuff with this inexpensive unit.The only drawback i have found is the buttons are very hard to engage and disengage.But i&#39;m working on that. i will modify the springs if possible and maybe even send a recommendation to Danelectro.&#34;,
 &#39;More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan\&#39;s books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn\&#39;t feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine\&#39;s point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the &#34;dark&#34; series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you\&#39;re kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!&#39;,
 &#39;A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn&#39;t so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.&#34;,
 &#34;Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can&#39;t put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It&#39;s nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.&#34;,
 &#39;Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It\&#39;s also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always &#34;one against the world&#34;, Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer\&#39;s fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can\&#39;t wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.&#39;,
 &#39;Great Beginning...poor ending: Parricia Corwell, Cruel &amp; Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning! Her relation to her family, her dedication to her work exeptional. However, this story began to get boring towards the end...the ending, not too great.&#39;,
 &#39;12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make....: Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell, I have heard many more clever jokes and &#34;one-liners&#34; watching King of Queens on cable.....SERIOUSLY FOLKS, it\&#39;s THAT BAD....the bad jokes and the 23 references to small jewish penises got old real quick. Thought i would always be a Sandler fan but he clearly, Adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and RAN!Why else would the plot line include Seth Rogan writing for him??? To put things into perspective, this film made Bruno look like Casablanca!!&#39;,
 &#39;I wish Adam Sandler wasn\&#39;t in this.: I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it\&#39;s true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible &amp; crude &#34;jokes&#34;. I have to say we didn\&#39;t make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don\&#39;t believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.&#39;,
 &#39;Wonderful, baffling mix: This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird&#39;,
 &#39;No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....&#39;,
 &#34;Disappointment at it&#39;s extreme: I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader&#39;s attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author.&#34;,
 &#34;From Potter&#39;s Field by Patricia Cornwell.: This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It&#39;s a real page turner and keeps you wondering what&#39;s going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.&#34;,
 &#39;An Engrossing and Chilling Read: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the &#34;evil&#34; Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give &#34;gifts&#34; to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say, I will be reading more of Cornwell\&#39;s books, especially if they are at all like this novel.&#39;,
 &#39;great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie, where is it?: the publisher said soon to be a movie. does anyone know if a movie was ever created?&#39;,
 &#34;Simply Awesome!: This was only my first Cornwell novel and I&#39;m hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can&#39;t wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.&#34;,
 &#34;Predictable &amp; has a lame ending: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels &amp; this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever &amp; wish she&#39;d die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic &amp; self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies &amp; the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer&#39;s family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don&#39;t let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel.&#34;,
 &#39;Black Knight C2C Heat Squash Racquet: Great racquet! But I\&#39;m a power hitter I have no power Generating Difficulty With This racquet. My style is to try to volleyball and everything I\&#39;ve found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered. I like the factory grip although with distinct ridges Others prefer a smooth grip May - give the factory grip on chance and you May Come to like it. The &#34;sale&#34; prices are right for a high About end racquet, racquets and Black Knight in Have a reputation for overall durability so you Should get plenty of use Before replacement. Note: I got my first C2C as a D level player and did not like it Immediately. Howeve, as my game improved version I switched from my Bandit Black Knight C2C White racquet to the great success and Have HAD. So, It Might not be the right racquet for a beginner, intermediate to advanced players But Will Benefit From this fine racquet.&#39;,
 &#34;A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn&#39;t going to learn anything new. It&#39;s obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40&#39;s as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there&#39;s economics in action.&#34;,
 &#34;Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure, back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book&#39;s greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today&#39;s analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions &amp; conclusions. On the other hand, meteorologists seem to do quite well.Naturally the radical libertarians, tea-baggers &amp; Republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence. I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty &amp; irrational.&#34;,
 &#39;sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band: edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky, secluded,isolating tunes. i envision a ironical pace. i thought she was from chicago, millions and millions of people, and she sings stark loneliness&#39;,
 &#34;Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I&#39;m very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!&#34;,
 &#34;Had to return it: The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5&#39;2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy, just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don&#39;t like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn&#39;t feel smooth all over. Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage. If you do decide to purchase this product it&#39;s easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.&#34;,
 &#34;Broke the 2nd time I wore it, great until then: I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn&#39;t quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn&#39;t particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.&#34;,
 &#34;The amazing squeem: I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture, you eat much less since it squeezes the he&#39;ll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.&#34;,
 &#39;Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core, which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy.&#39;,
 &#39;I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.: I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6, I\&#39;m 5\&#39;4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn\&#39;t much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I\&#39;d ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6&#34; above my hips. I don\&#39;t want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you\&#39;re similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last.&#39;,
 &#34;WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through: The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can&#39;t say that I didn&#39;t take good care of it.&#34;,
 &#34;CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG: I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn&#39;t. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I&#39;m black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn&#39;t see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you!&#34;,
 &#34;Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I&#39;m ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I&#39;m a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.&#34;,
 &#34;nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That&#39;s why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn&#39;t fit.&#34;,
 &#34;Does the job: I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn&#39;t elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can&#39;t wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect.&#34;,
 &#34;conspiracy theorist: The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot&#39;s mind actually works.&#34;,
 &#34;Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I&#39;m led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger, don&#39;t waste your money. The cover price of .....is an insult and the deeply discounted .......... price will still leave you feeling ripped-off. Go to your local library in the morning and you&#39;ll finish Edge of Danger in time for an early lunch. Just don&#39;t expect to have any appetite left.&#34;,
 &#39;1, and thats being generous....: I have read many of Jack Higgins\&#39; books and this is the poorest so far, in my humble belief. As I travelled thro\&#39; the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro\&#39; the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I\&#39;m afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read&#34;To Tess, who thinks it\&#39;s about time&#34;Author, I think she may mean something else....&#39;,
 &#34;Good matt nude lipstick: It&#39;s got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can&#39;t apply too much or else it&#39;ll look a bit dry.&#34;,
 &#39;I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent: West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.&#39;,
 &#39;A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe: A refreshing, sunwarmed, beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other &#34;Woman against the odds&#34; novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel\&#39;s &#34;Shelters of Stone&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!&#39;,
 &#39;Avoid it.: The abridged version of this book would read as so:&#34;Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong.&#34;There ya go. Nuff said. I don\&#39;t need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it.&#39;,
 &#39;ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...&#39;,
 &#34;The Scarlet Letter: I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can&#39;t go wrong with the classics.&#34;,
 &#39;This edition is not complete: This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author\&#39;s introductory chapter, &#34;The Custom-House.&#34; Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let\&#39;s face it, who else is going to read it? This isn\&#39;t exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader\&#39;s guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition.&#39;,
 &#34;Creepy: The creepiest book I&#39;ve ever read! It&#39;s a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol&#34;,
 &#34;A book for those with time on their hands: If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don&#39;t read it unless you don&#39;t mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point.&#34;,
 &#39;Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don\&#39;t know how this book made it into that sacred list we call &#34;classics&#34;. Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?&#39;,
 &#34;Great novel: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn&#39;t let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans.&#34;,
 &#34;Horrible reader: i couldn&#39;t listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you&#39;re into audio books&#34;,
 &#34;Mistake?: I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn&#39;t ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn&#39;t work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I&#39;d already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again.&#34;,
 &#39;The &#34;Scarlet&#34; Letter: Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It\&#39;s an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.&#39;,
 &#39;The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American: The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American.&#39;,
 &#39;The Scarlet Letter: A soap opera: Although this book, is considered a great work of literature, written to describe the harshness of Purtian New England. Plus, this book was heavily laiden with symbolism, and many other literary tools.The scarlet letter is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. Not only is it boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. This boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages. This is a good book to study, however it is not a good book to read for pleasure, under any circumstance!!&#39;,
 &#34;This book is Great!: One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter, I disagree. It&#39;s no wonder that people that don&#39;t know how to capitalize the word &#39;I&#39;. I thought that this book was wonderful, if you are willing to put effort into understanding it.&#34;,
 &#34;I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I&#39;m not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.&#34;,
 &#39;Possibly the funniest movie ever made.: It starts off a bit slow, but once the product placement jokes start it takes off.&#39;,
 &#34;same problems as munchkin version: Ditto to other complaints - won&#39;t separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I&#39;m looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin&#34;,
 &#34;Sassy Baby Warming Dish. Interesting concept.: We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small, and didn&#39;t really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant, although I think a blanket would work just as well.Recommendation:Buy********************HoldSell&#34;,
 &#39;Unreadable!: As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate.&#39;,
 &#34;Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you&#39;re worried about the environment.&#34;,
 &#34;Two Tedious Hours: The early success of Adam Sandler&#39;s films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We&#39;ve all seen the trick, so it&#39;s just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.&#34;,
 &#39;one of the worst movies of 2002: god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider and others contribute voices.&#39;,
 &#39;Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie.&#39;,
 &#39;very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all.&#39;,
 &#34;Sandler Strikes Out: 8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it&#39;s probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running.&#34;,
 &#39;Not the worst, but far from good: This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book &#34;The 50 worst films of all time&#34;. It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!&#39;,
 &#39;Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?: I have, too, but this isn\&#39;t it. The translation is very choppy, the singers are medicore at best, and the orchestrations are too overwhelming. &#34;Love Changes Everything&#34; is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to it.Oddly, the best song is the French &#34;Chanson d\&#39;Enfance.&#34;I was very surprised, as the Japanese usually put out extramely good cast CDS. Their CATS and Phantom and the Tokoyo Evita are all great. But unless you are a total ALW or AOL fanatic, save your money.&#39;,
 &#39;It Rises above the &#34;Fluff&#34; Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on &#34;emotional states&#34; and music. It\&#39;s hard to find a book on this subject that\&#39;s across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It\&#39;s a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book\&#39;s far from perfect, but it\&#39;s the best I\&#39;ve seen so far on this topic.&#39;,
 &#39;Itten The Elements of Color: I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition, rather than very good. I would like to thank the person who made it possible, but have misplaced her name and address.&#39;,
 &#39;great IMO: First of all, I saw the review by &#34;Tyley Mike &#34;Relite&#34;&#34; and thought he was grossly overcritical of EVERYTHING and every instrument played... so I\&#39;d like to hear Tyley Mike\&#39;s album, since he thinks he can do better :) --seriously! I think some people don\&#39;t understand that things sound the way they were MEANT to sound, if they sound poppy, they made it that way, why the hell should they stick to the norm? They want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great.I can\&#39;t write a good enough review for this album, all their albums actually, as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting. It bugs me when a group doesn\&#39;t evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were, all the time, so I was glad to see them progress and &#34;grow&#34;.There\&#39;s too much to say to describe this album, but frankly I don\&#39;t think I could write a good enough review to do it justice, so I\&#39;ll just give it my 5 stars :)&#39;,
 &#39;I wish...: ...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons. It is still wonderful music and Ill explore it further...&#39;,
 &#34;Good follow-up to El Cielo.: A bit of a change this time for Dredg, less progressive material, more straight ahead rock tunes. I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn&#39;t have alot of stuff going on like with El Cielo which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms. But still this is the direction they chose to go in and it&#39;s definitely a very good one.&#34;,
 &#39;WOW!: This book really bothers me. If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability, do not read this book. It does not offer any advice for parents, just helps fuel negativitiy. Please do not put yourself through reading this book. If you are still in the grieving stage, this book will not help you. As parents, please try surrounding yourself with positives. Children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life. They can help you learn, help you become more empathetic, help you become stronger, and bring wonderful caring people into your life. Please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life. Do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration, anger, sadness, and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives.&#39;,
 &#34;80s Hard Rock: One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!! It&#39;s pity that they are almost retiring soon...&#34;,
 &#34;Low class effort by High Class Band: This material represents why the 80&#39;s died, the music is bland and poppy, the Wilson sister&#39;s garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.&#34;,
 &#39;Good Quality Cell Phone Holder: Contrary to other review, I found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever.&#39;,
 &#39;Loved it!: I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!&#39;,
 &#39;Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!: I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!&#39;,
 &#34;There is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review....: This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn&#39;t like Vince Guardaldi&#39;s jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn&#39;t air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it.&#34;,
 &#39;I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! &#34;They don\&#39;t know entertainment&#34; as Krusty would say: I do love &#34;Charlie Brown\&#39;s Christmas&#34;, a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn\&#39;t know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because &#34;Charlie Brown\&#39;s Christmas&#34; had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!&#39;,
 &#39;Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.&#39;,
 &#39;Proof that good things are built to last: When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus\&#39;s Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - &#34;Sparky&#34; hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year\&#39;s Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts\&#39; style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.&#39;,
 &#39;great Christmas gift: This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.&#39;,
 &#34;Yahoo for Charlie Brown: Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can&#39;t always catch it on TV.&#34;,
 &#34;The Best Present Of All: My children are a little old (age-wise) for this, but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year. This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come.Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special. I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday. Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic. This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus&#39; delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children. This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone&#39;s collection.&#34;,
 &#39;Classic: Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself, with her as well as with my hubby. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!&#39;,
 &#39;Not a real Rammstein album.: Bootleg collection of b-sides, remixes, and singles. Really, why even bother?&#39;,
 &#34;After a few months- broken: This charger worked fine for a few months, but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it&#39;s charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality.&#34;,
 &#39;Works great, and half the price: This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15&#34; Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad, it was a nice touch).&#39;,
 &#34;This is a good product!: When my Mac Powerbook G4&#39;s cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn&#39;t sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you&#39;re worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4&#34;,
 &#34;Quite Satisfactory: This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn&#39;t have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that&#39;s a minor thing. Also doesn&#39;t have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original, but once again, that&#39;s a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase.&#34;,
 &#34;Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it&#39;s built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that&#39;s more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended.&#34;,
 &#34;Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple&#39;s replacement, I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT, and cool bluish color. The cable that breaks on Apple&#39;s charger is noticeably thicker on this charger.Get this. You&#39;ll not regret it.&#34;,
 &#39;Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.&#39;,
 &#39;Cheap, Doesn\&#39;t charge, dangerous, power cord: This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15&#34; Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn\&#39;t actually a 65watt power cord... so don\&#39;t expect to use your computer while it\&#39;s charging... and don\&#39;t expect to be able to touch the &#34;brick&#34; as it\&#39;s plugged in, you\&#39;ll burn yourself.I\&#39;ve returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better.&#39;,
 &#34;So much better than the apple version!: I love it, it&#39;s LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn&#39;t get hot! It&#39;s wonderful!&#34;,
 &#39;Good product at reasonable price: Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply, it seems to work fine--and it is very reasonably priced. Too bad that Amazon stopped carrying the supply.&#39;,
 &#39;If you\&#39;re tempted to throw away $30....: I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14&#34;). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don\&#39;t think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.&#39;,
 &#34;Plug DOESN&#39;T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn&#39;t compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn&#39;t work.Consider yourself warned.&#34;,
 &#34;Stopped Working Day 3: Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn&#39;t void my refund.I&#39;ve ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I&#39;ve had good luck with other Macally gear.&#34;,
 &#34;Another Binchy Great: This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy&#39;s style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding.&#34;,
 &#39;TU VIDA JAMAS VOLVERA A SER LA MISMA: Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente, todo tiene sentido y gracias a estos conocimientos he podido ayudar a otras seres a vivir su vida con un proposito que es ser mejores cada dia para pasar de nivel en nuestro crecimiento espiritual; este libro no es para aquellas personas que le tienen miedo a la verdad; pero si te atrevez a leerlo te aseguro que tu vida jamas volvera a ser la misma.ATREVETE!!!&#39;,
 &#39;Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of &#34;playing with future&#34; is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull&#39;,
 &#34;book only, no jacks: I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but &#39;like new&#39;. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn&#39;t come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!&#34;,
 &#39;Thomas connector tracks: The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.&#39;,
 &#39;Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though &#34;O please get over yourself&#34;. I didn\&#39;t finish the book, it was a waste of time.&#39;,
 &#34;Disturbing.: If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author&#39;s whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn&#39;t their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else.&#34;,
 &#39;Not Very good: I dont advise buying this grider, it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper.&#39;,
 &#34;Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn&#39;t work. Disappointing.&#34;,
 &#34;Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark: Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year&#39;s essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It&#39;s still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short.&#34;,
 &#39;My Girl Likes It: My two and half years old girl likes it so much, and every I want to allure her to bed to sleep, I will say read I Spy in bed.&#39;,
 &#39;Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception, but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would of gave it a 5 if I had not read the others.&#39;,
 &#39;I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.&#39;,
 &#39;Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtail.Children are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start.&#39;,
 &#34;Climalite works as intended: More visually interesting than plain white, and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton. But please don&#39;t wear them with sandals, they aren&#39;t that visually interesting!The bottom black part is thicker, but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use...you know what I mean...thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear.The uppers, the white and colored part are thin, stretchy and breathable, flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no-shows if you choose.&#34;,
 &#39;A Man of Reason: At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea &#34;Individual Rights&#34; down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine\&#39;s contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that &#34;we have it in our power to make the world over again&#34;, and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man\&#39;s life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing &#34;We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way&#34;. Let\&#39;s work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!&#39;,
 &#39;I was there: I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.&#39;,
 &#39;Course Book: Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.&#39;,
 &#34;Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group&#39;s leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.&#34;,
 &#39;Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly\&#39;s &#34;Hungry Again,&#34; and her return to real country. I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind), makes an entire album of great music, instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music, I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash\&#39;s &#34;I Still Miss Someone&#34; gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely &#34;Will He Be Waiting For Me.&#34; This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn\&#39;t be happier. I\&#39;m 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren\&#39;t just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.&#39;,
 &#34;Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!: As a child, I grew up in Knoxville, TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm &amp; Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn&#39;t really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately, she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly&#39;s voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean, I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.) Dolly&#39;s gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the Grammy&#39;s with The Grass is Blue and Trio II. A Top 10 CD if I ever heard one!&#34;,
 &#34;Band saves CD: As usual, Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She&#39;s attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn&#39;t work.&#34;,
 &#34;Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is too short! Lhasa&#39;s voice is sultry, sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!&#34;,
 &#39;The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!&#39;,
 &#34;non stop adventure: This was a great and is very magical. A young boy&#39;s nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him, you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure!!!&#34;,
 &#34;worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don&#39;t waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!&#34;,
 &#34;One of my favorites as a kid: I loved this book when I was about eight years old, and looking back on it, it&#39;s easy to see why: William, the main character, is a gymnast (just as I was) who&#39;s rather shy and reserved (just as I was) but manages, when it&#39;s important, to help the people around him. He&#39;s immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn&#39;t hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L&#39;Engle&#39;s A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults. I have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed-time reading.&#34;,
 &#34;excellent: Good price, excellent design and shipped well.Would&#39;ve been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving.&#34;,
 &#34;Best witch book i&#39;ve ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come.&#34;,
 &#39;Maybe next time...: I, like a lot of people writing reviews, play a lot of first person shooters. If you liked Splinter Cell, buy TRAOD USED!!! I agree with everyone here...story is good, controls are less than mediocre. Even Enter the Matrix blew this game away. Customizing the keyboard helps some, but less than what I expected. I tried to leave feedback for EIDOS, but to no avail. Hopefully, if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer. And for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc, I can assure you that is NOT the case.&#39;,
 &#39;To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome, but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game.&#39;,
 &#34;Lara should have remained in the tomb: I was so looking forward to this game being released, I was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date. Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it&#39;s release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven&#39;t felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game, which is what games are all about. Sorry Core and Eidos, this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well. What a boost this could have been for you.&#34;,
 &#39;Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.&#39;,
 &#34;Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book: This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn&#39;t happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!&#34;,
 &#39;this will interest children in insects: This would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes. It has a wonderful layout, with many beautiful photographs (if insects can be called beautiful). The text, mixed nicely with the pictures, covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts.&#39;,
 &#34;Good, but only to the midway point: This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It&#39;s spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator&#39;s point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.&#34;,
 &#34;a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn&#39;t fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON&#39;T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS.&#34;,
 &#34;BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn&#39;t even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can&#39;t believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn&#39;t have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....&#34;,
 &#34;Didactic melodrama: I have read enough to know when I&#39;m being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended.&#34;,
 &#39;Well, not everything: It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn\&#39;t apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of &#34;real life&#34; examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it\&#39;s better to be a &#34;good enough&#34; parent than a perfect one. By Klein\&#39;s opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I\&#39;m 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting.&#39;,
 &#34;Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don&#39;t help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn&#39;t make any sense. It&#39;s very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.&#34;,
 &#39;Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of &#34;executive summary&#34; of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.&#39;,
 &#39;The Top Ten List for Christians byJames W. Moore: A bit simplistic at times, but got some good discussions goingin our Sunday School class (Methodist). Would recommend itfor Contemporary Adult Sunday School classes or Bible studies.&#39;,
 &#39;Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome, so has a good seal to it.&#39;,
 &#34;elem diff e-q&#39;s: While the shipping was AMAZING, the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading.&#34;,
 &#34;This is really cool!: This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they&#39;ve improved with time. Good cd!&#34;,
 &#34;Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you&#39;d think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past.&#34;,
 &#39;A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein\&#39;s &#34;How to get control of time and your life&#34;, which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author\&#39;s and those he quotes cutltural background.&#39;,
 &#39;Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?: I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!&#39;,
 &#39;Almost perfect: Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch, so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more.&#39;,
 &#39;Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8&#34; and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for.&#39;,
 &#34;The meaning of God, the meaning of life.: Both of these issues, among others, are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters, all of whom we recognize.What lies beneath the skin of the average person? What do they believe in, and why? What makes their worlds shatter? What would make your world shatter?The author never wastes a word, entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways. It&#39;s a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world. This makes the book touching on a personal level. I think every reader will find a different way, and reason, to love this book.&#34;,
 &#39;What a disappointment!: I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future.&#39;,
 &#39;You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now.&#39;,
 &#34;junk!: Don&#39;t buy this! Didn&#39;t even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.&#34;,
 &#39;fireplace tool set: Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.&#39;,
 &#39;Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.&#39;,
 &#34;Long Hot Summer: Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river, two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots, you will relish this haunting book. I can&#39;t wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia.&#34;,
 &#34;Mathematical nonsense: Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn&#39;t own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.&#34;,
 &#39;Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.&#39;,
 &#34;Stuck With You: I didn&#39;t really like the book. If the author didn&#39;t write the sex portion of the book, there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.&#34;,
 &#34;None: Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn&#39;t put this down and laughed, smiled, and even got tears! A brand new favorite author.&#34;,
 &#34;Witty and clever.: This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel&#39;s storyline had been included, just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan.&#34;,
 &#34;Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry: Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I&#39;ve mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted, anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs. Although there are no spontanious songs on this one, his CDs from his independent labels are loaded with them. He has a talent for ushering believers into God&#39;s presence.The songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics. This is a must have. This CD is out of print and if you can get your hands on one - do it quickly!&#34;,
 &#39;lousy, outdated guide, with horrible printing flaws!: First thing I noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together. No, really...they were. The printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book. There were many pages that had to be hand cut just to TURN them. I could not stand the ... design. Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications.MIGHT be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually READ them.&#39;,
 &#34;Still yet to recieve: I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I&#39;ve tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!&#34;,
 &#34;Big things in small package: When I purchased this small hardcover book, I didn&#39;t expect very much. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.LBW is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship.This is a must read that is well-written and culturally enlightening.&#34;,
 &#39;broken :(: The base and frame were not completely attached. Fixed with a little glue. My friend loved it after that.&#39;,
 &#39;Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the &#34;ON&#34; button, but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the &#34;OFF&#34; to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons, to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement), but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent, reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer.&#39;,
 &#34;Left me feeling wanting.........: Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn&#39;t have bought it. He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines?&#34;,
 &#34;Gun Digest 1911 Review: This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Excellent tutorial and very entertaining. The detailed discriptions and the pictures were informative. I spoke with the recipient of the gift after Christmas and he agreed. I really appreciate Amazon&#39;s speedy service.&#34;,
 &#34;THIS CD SUCKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE, AND IT REALLY SUCKED!!!!! IF SOMEONE IS ITNERESTED IN BUYING THIS, DON&#39;T, IT&#39;S A WATSE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!&#34;,
 &#39;Nice but Sony must give us more info: This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information&#39;,
 &#39;LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion: This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.&#39;,
 &#34;CUT IT UP DEF: IT&#39;S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.&#34;,
 &#39;I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.&#39;,
 &#39;More Fiction than fact: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of &#34;Billy the Kid&#34; so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.&#39;,
 &#39;waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Squiggler fell apart at second use, with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard, horribly designed and made product!!!!!&#39;,
 &#39;CO alarm: Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.j.&#39;,
 &#34;Easy as it can be.: I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all, but she had no trouble with setting this up. She&#39;s completely happy, California is happy, and I&#39;m happy.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;THE ROCKETS RED GLARE&#34; ???: This over-priced pain in &#34;the sitting area&#34; has an always-on, glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don\&#39;t have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug.&#39;,
 &#39;Absolutely great tripod for movie camera: excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of &#34;shaky&#34; movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price&#39;,
 &#39;A written masterpiece: I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible, this book is a masterpiece unparalleled.&#39;,
 &#34;Love Jerry and Dean, just not this version: I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film, however, the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally, it wasn&#39;t listed as a DVD-R, but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection.&#34;,
 &#39;Crap, Junk, Worthless, etc: The other 1-star poster is absolutely correct; these things are crap. I ordered two of them for both my kids and neither worked at all. The rockets didn\&#39;t seal on the pump so no pressure could be pumped into them, thus making them useless. I had high hopes for this toy because of my love for it when I was younger. As always, the quality of these &#34;nostalgic&#34; toys leave much to be desired (I\&#39;m looking at you, Evel Knievel Dare Devil Stunt Set!). The price is cheap, but the quality is cheaper.&#39;,
 &#39;Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles.&#39;,
 &#39;I\&#39;d give it 6+ stars if I could!: The cover blurb on this book says it all: &#34;For office slaves, Internet addicts and stressed-out students.&#34; (ha! I am all three) If you are like me and have looked at many a Yoga book but put them aside due to the difficult positions/instructions or the time involved, but still want to feel better, relax and also rejuivinate, AS well as relieve the symptoms of the computer age, then this is the book for you. A definate must-buy!&#39;,
 &#34;An American Treasure: Charles Brown is an American treasure. His blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals. The selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that CB has produced his entire life. Buy this cd. Buy any cd by Charles Brown. You won&#39;t regret it.&#34;,
 &#34;not finding comfort in food: I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However, this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self-confidence. It is not true, obviously. I am not overweight and never had any eating disorders, but I just don&#39;t have a positive self-image. So if you&#39;re like me, don&#39;t read this book. I couldn&#39;t relate to it. The title is misleading.&#34;,
 &#34;Typical Thomas video, all about James: THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James&#39;s brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn&#39;t have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn&#39;t realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.&#34;,
 &#39;Inexpensive but poor quality: The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn\&#39;t have to do that with a brand &#34;new&#34; product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can\&#39;t imagine using them for metal, let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price, I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons.&#39;,
 &#34;Dull and dirty: Well I don&#39;t usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what&#39;s up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we&#39;ll see&#34;,
 &#34;Deserving of the Pulitzer it won; but don&#39;t be scared by it.: Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I&#39;ve met many of them. This book also gives the reader an understanding of the world in which they grew up. A world where Stalin was (literally) God. A world without independent thought. Fascinating, heart wrenching. Very readable.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Like this&#34; by Technotronic featuring Monday Midnite: Like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless Technobeat with no specific direction. This song brought back the good memories of the 70\&#39;s by using a sample of the classic &#34;clean up the ghetto&#34;. Monday Midnite\&#39;s freestyle story about his experience at a London underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and I like it a lot. Plus, the song keeps you dancing till the last beat. Love it.&#39;,
 &#39;A Disappointing Misrepresentation: Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book\&#39;s writter, Dorie Greenspan I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [i.e., only 8 shows from this far more extensive series] selection of the books recipes. What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is &#34;Buyer beware&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;A peek inside the process.: First thing\&#39;s first, &#34;Homespun&#34; is an album of demos for &#34;Apple Venus&#34;. If you don\&#39;t have that record, look there first (although if you\&#39;re new to XTC, &#34;Skylarking&#34; is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it\&#39;s a track-by-track match for &#34;Apple Venus&#34;. Sonically, you couldn\&#39;t tell it\&#39;s so much a set of demos except in a couple places (&#34;Frivolous Tonight&#34;) because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn\&#39;t expect it like orchestral workouts &#34;River of Orchids&#34; and &#34;Green Man&#34;.Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (&#34;Knights in Shining Karma&#34;), but truth to be told, unless you\&#39;re a diehard, you probably don\&#39;t need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out &#34;Apple Venus&#34;, it\&#39;s a fine record.&#39;,
 &#34;As good as the guy&#39;s new book on Horatio Nelson.: I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor&#39;s. It is also as good as Hayward&#39;s new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy&#39;s work.&#34;,
 &#34;a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories: I&#39;ve read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler&#39;s 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I&#39;ve read about the airlift effort to save Paulus&#39; 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read.&#34;,
 &#34;Do Not Buy This Software!: I tried this software as an alternative to ULead&#39;s DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead&#39;s software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN&#39;T WORK. I&#39;ve tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven&#39;t heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software...&#34;,
 &#39;Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray]: This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!&#39;,
 &#39;Awesome: This movie was awesome! The picture and sound quality were top notch as well as the bonus content. Definitely worth every cent.&#39;,
 &#39;I am so glad I found this!: At one time this cereal was available in my local stores. However it was discontinued. I searched the internet and finally found &#34;Quaker Oat Bran&#34; here. The cereal is great it is crunchy and holds the crunchiness even after you add the milk. I love the flavor and it helps to control my cholesterol too.&#39;,
 &#34;Excellent.....REALLY: Once I recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print, I realized I&#39;d just read an earth shattering book on Wicca and Witchcraft. Taken in hand, with all the books with bad history, this book fixes them all. Just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its place.It is unapologetically Modernistic, with the sources to back it up.EXCELLENT, really, EXCELLENT.&#34;,
 &#39;Its a cable: Its a cable, it works, what else do you want? I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says &#34;sony&#34; on it. Yea!! But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for. Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market. who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products.&#39;,
 &#39;awesome book to explain death to children: The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m grateful for this book: We had two beloved cats die during my child&#39;s fifth year and I wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently. This book doesn&#39;t promise eternal life or give any religious message. In several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life. My girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime, which I found slightly surprising.&#34;,
 &#39;Effective book for discussing physical death with a child: As a public school librarian, I would say that &#34;Lifetimes&#34; is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: &#34;Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever.&#34; This statement either reflects the authors\&#39; intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I\&#39;d suggest that &#34;Lifetimes&#34; be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child\&#39;s questions based on a family\&#39;s belief system.&#39;,
 &#39;Great band even better now: Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music.When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice.These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare.The music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.Tell Me, I lost everything today,The only one, and got me going are some of the ones that stand out to me.The cover of the Police\&#39;s &#34;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&#34; is one of the more interesting covers I have ever heard.If you liked &#34;From One&#34; the buy this disc. I would love to see these guy live.&#39;,
 &#34;USA1: Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today?? No footnotes or primary sources listed for such conclusions?? Are we supposed to believe these pinheads just because they have PHD behind their name? The other side can list hundreds of primary sources in their works. I&#39;m sure all the pc teachers and profs love this and it will probably be a staple at every modern college. Not worth a dime for a thinking person who really wants the truth.&#34;,
 &#34;Worst Night World book: This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith&#39;s worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero[Thierry is the best]. He is stupid[he cheated on the SATs].If you haven&#39;t read any of the Night World books, don&#39;t start with this one.&#34;,
 &#39;This book is messed up: In this book, not only is there no real &#34;love&#34; scenes, but to top it off, the girl\&#39;s cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate. Granted, Angel is dead, but he\&#39;s still related to her and definately should NOT be trying to catch his own cousin. Ewww. To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a \&#39;coming of age\&#39; story about how being popluar isn\&#39;t the most important. I love every other Night World book, but this is retarded.&#39;,
 &#39;Impressive: One of the few CDs of Asatru music that I actually enjoy. I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD.&#39;,
 &#39;The Haiku Year exemplifies integrating creativity: This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions. Read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts. Perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book...&#39;,
 &#39;Not What I\&#39;d Hoped For: I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago. Instead, this meandering book comprises &#34;hick&#34; UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel\&#39;s trust-me-I- know-what-I\&#39;m-talking-about theories and explanations. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men (in black) behaving badly. With little to recommend it (and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings, there\&#39;s no other recommendation), &#34;The Mothman Prophecies&#34; is a considerable disappointment.&#39;,
 &#39;SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!: Let me just start by saying that the &#34; MOTHMAN PROPHECIES&#34; is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he\&#39;s a parinoid delusional whack. I\&#39;m only 15, and I don\&#39;t buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead.&#39;,
 &#39;And the point was...?: Although I prefer books with an actual plot, I don\&#39;t mind reading choppy, journal-type entries if there is actually a point to all of it, or if at least such entries are entertaining. This book\&#39;s are, albeit only in the beginning. After a while you\&#39;ll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that\&#39;s just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn\&#39;t worth the time--or the title. There\&#39;s hardly anything about &#34;the mothman&#34; in it.&#39;,
 &#34;Mothman proficies ?: 257 pages covering Men in Black, lights in the sky, and phone troubles. 10 pages about the Mothman. If you want to read the same old 70&#39;s UFO stories, this is your book. If you want to read about the Mothman, buy something else.&#34;,
 &#39;Never Before.......: Have I quit reading a book.I made it to page 123 before I had to stop. I\&#39;ve waited years to read this, oh man was I disappointed.I thought it would be an intelligent well written peice on the mothman mystery. I don\&#39;t know what this was. Holy mackeral. i\&#39;ve never seen such bad writing. Someone else mentioned incoherent, tell me about it! This was all over the place. I had absolutely no clue was was going on in this book. Just crazy!Just a few of my favourites:&#34; so horrified she dropped the small baby in her arms. The child began to cry, more insulted than hurt.&#34; what!? I\&#39;m thinking the kids was more hurt than insulted. This Keel dude is too much....Talking about this &#34;mysterious&#34; guy Tiny who a witness said saw a wire running up his pant leg. and i quote&#34; was tiny wearing electric socks? or was he a wired android operated by remote control.&#34;what???! pretty much where I stopped before my mind turned to mush&#39;,
 &#39;Are you joking?: I\&#39;m giving it one star because less isn\&#39;t possible here.You people _do_ realize that this book and all others of its kind are complete and utter fiction, right? There is and can be no truth behind them whatsoever: no science, no documentary or physical evidence, nothing! There are no MIBs (except in the movies), no secret &#34;conspiracies&#34; to hide evidence of alien visitations, no alien abductions,... absolutely none of this book or any of its kind are true.Ask yourselves: If this is really true, then why, with our government so unable to keep secrets about presidential peccadillos, financial scandals, politcal dirty tricks, payoffs, espionage and intelligence screwups and the like, how any &#34;conspiracy&#34; of this magnitude escaped detection and revelation?It simply makes no sense. It is pure entertainment, nothing more.And you Five-Star reviewers have credit cards....?&#39;,
 &#39;fine if you support terrorism: I find the terrorist links in her songs offensive.Taken from Fire Fire-&#34;Growin up, Brewin UpGuerilla gettin trained uplook out look outFrom over the Rooftop&#34; [reffering to LTTE snipers]&#34;Competition coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop&#34;She has a lot of LTTE propaganda in her music website, and even promotes this terrorist organisation in her music. She needs to get a grip, and the people buying her music need to get a grip and actually look at what they\&#39;re buying here.&#39;,
 &#34;Good for afterwork cruising, better for airplane tranquility: Listening to this cd, I turned my car stereo all the way up, on my way back from work. The lyric is very ostentatious and the beats are showy. 10 dollars and Hombre are two of my favorite tracks, they are both clever yet funny. It does have a political overtone, but it&#39;s ok, I like the revolution type mood. It&#39;s actually very good stuff when you are on a plane, totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat, and you can imagine a party in your head.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the big deal?: The only thing interesting about this album is mia&#39;s accent. Seriously, the beats her singing is layered over are tired and clichéd. If the vocals on this album were by anyone else it would not be in the top 500. Final Verdict: Bad music.&#34;,
 &#39;Excellant: I love Kala as well, because it sounds cleaner and more developed. However this album was an excellant break out in her career. fire, fire is one of my favorites. Mix with marijuana.&#39;,
 &#34;So Original, So Fun: A friend introduced me to this CD and it&#39;s quickly become a favourite. M.I.A.&#39;s music so catchy and so fun to dance to, yet it&#39;s also lasting...I&#39;ve been listening to it over and over. And I love the fact that she brings an ethnic vibe into her music.&#34;,
 &#39;noritake colorwave stoneware: I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time.&#39;,
 &#34;A wish to time travel to 1880&#39;s Rockaway.: Old Rockaway, New York in Early Photographs, exceeded my expectations! I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930&#39;s and 1940&#39;s. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#39;Old age gold...: As a 27 year old man from the UK, I was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time (which was quite frankly, before my time). I love it and hope you do too.Thanks, OC.&#39;,
 &#39;Tiene que ser sensilla!!: Quien no va a ser sensilla con la poca fama, talento, y bellesa que esta mujer tiene? No tiene voz suave, ni fuerte. Deveria dedicarse a otra cosa. Lo que sea.. menos cantar, y actuar porque seria igual de ridicula que Patty Navidad!! Este es uno de los peores Discos que he escuchado en toda mi vida!!&#39;,
 &#34;Repetitive and monotone: I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don&#39;t really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly.&#34;,
 &#39;Worst book I\&#39;ve ever read: This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality. This was the first book I &#34;attempted&#34; to read by the author, since I couldn\&#39;t waste my time trying to finish it. I am pretty sure I won\&#39;t be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade.&#39;,
 &#39;Frankenstein Continued??: When I first heard about this book, I wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation. Fortunately, a continuation.I had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock, I bought it. I read it in 4 days, reading each night after work. I can say it was a good read. Steady flowing action, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc. I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt. But, never fear, there is to be 3 more books before the real ending. So, we all have something to look forward to.This is only the second Koontz book I have read, so I was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing. More die hard Koontz fans may be able to tell the difference.So, overall a good, smooth, never dull, read. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist.&#39;,
 &#39;Fine until it started eating tapes: Like many of the other reviewers, my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous &#34;Remove cassette&#34; message and is mangling tapes. I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years. Search the web for &#34;canon zr users group&#34; and &#34;eating tapes&#34; to hear similar horror stories. Stay away from Canon camcorders.&#39;,
 &#34;My [Goodness]!!!!: world.....do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted [money]buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing [for less]including firewire, 4 dv&#39;s, and a carrying caseIt is honestly the worst, disgusting, and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw [your money]into the atlantic oceanDO NOT GET THIS EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT. RETURN IT. GET YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!&#34;,
 &#39;Lots of effects, lightweight &amp; easy to use.: Awesome Camcorder &amp; Camera functions in this lightweight, easy to use camcorder make it a breeze to shoot great memories for a novice like me, right out of the box. This camcorder also has a huge selection of special effects, and options to make really interesting video effects. I love this camcorder!&#39;,
 &#34;excellent book for the novice improviser to the instructor: Izzy does a great job of making the format of the book simple yet engaging. His explaination of the games with goals, group size, time, process and variations for each of the games is very helpful. It is written so that a sales team leader could pick it up and have some great games to get his/her team thinking creatively, working on teamwork and self confidence. My only complaint as a past performer and current instructor is that it isn&#39;t long enough. Write another.&#34;,
 &#39;hard -to-find tension rods: Our living room has a &#34;bow&#34; window with five narrow panels. I looked many places for narrow-but-strong tension rods. I was pleased to find these and to get free shipping. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you.&#39;,
 &#39;YES, YES, YES great read: Love the book..I was born 250 years too late..I would have liked to been there at the time...HOWEVER, massacre does not sound like it feels good ! lol&#39;,
 &#39;A MUST HAVE!: I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.&#39;,
 &#39;Paradise kiss rocks!!!!: OMG!! thats all i can say.its just sooo fabulous!!! when i first heard about it i was contridicting weather or not i should read it but then i decided ,&#34;hey why not?&#34; now that i read this fab manga,theres no turning back!!!this is totally a keeper! i strongly recomend!!!!&#39;,
 &#34;If you are a Nirvana fan this album is not for you.: I am a huge Nirvana fan I have been one ever since 1990 when I first listened to Bleach. If you are die hard like me you will not like this album, you probably already have all the songs on this album so don&#39;t waste your money. The only reason I would recommend someone to but this album is if they did not buy the box set. I wish I had my $10.00 back.&#34;,
 &#39;Ehh: The disc is intact but the case is in terrible ocndition. It is broken in half and chipped off of the top portion of the case.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;True&#34; Nirvana sucks: I\&#39;ll tell you what\&#39;s REALLY in the spirit of the band: that FBI seal and warning on the back cover that states that any and all duplications of the cd are &#34;illegal&#34;. Not that anybody would enjoy a duplication anyway. If this is &#34;true&#34; Nirvana, then &#34;true&#34; Nirvana sucks.&#39;,
 &#39;garbage: Complete garbage, the sound quality is horrible, if your going to release a best of cd, record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag.&#39;,
 &#39;Not what I expected: I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing.&#39;,
 &#34;Love these glasses: I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color, but I&#39;m wanting matching in a smaller glass and can&#39;t seem to find the same color. Anyway, I really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier. Also, these glasses are very stable, don&#39;t tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don&#39;t slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these.&#34;,
 &#39;Forsyte Saga - a well awarded but oft forgotten classic: I\&#39;ll make this short and to the point. I\&#39;m quite the avid reader, but usually I don\&#39;t enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more &#34;Adventure! Action!&#34; type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!&#39;,
 &#39;The book is great but the edition is an embarrasment: ... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word &#34;ficbe&#34; came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don\&#39;t they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition.&#39;,
 &#34;Expensive experiment that didn&#39;t work: I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn&#39;t really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn&#39;t work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done.&#34;,
 &#39;Lame Jujitsuka: I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised.&#39;,
 &#34;Small type: My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn&#39;t require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don&#39;t believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose.&#34;,
 &#34;Takes Tree-hugging to a New Level (Third): In the forest of Midworld, one had better learn to hug close to one&#39;s home tree or risk being killed by innumerable plants, animals, insects, and other beings less well categorized.Yet, despite a living space defined by various levels of Hell below and above, this planet accommodates a small group of humans who succeeded in adapting to its rigors. Ironically, the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clear-cut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greed,Alan Dean Foster is one of my favorite authors - though I remain envious of his imagination, writing skills, and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself. As much as possible on this planet, he&#39;s experienced much of the action he describes in his fiction.&#34;,
 &#39;Best Alan Dean Foster book!: I read this years ago when I was a pre-teen, and it had me hooked on SF.Alan Dean has let me down time and time again since, but this book is a classic.You MUST read this one. It\&#39;ll be fun, and you won\&#39;t be able to put it down.After finishing this one, try hunting down &#34;Dark Star&#34;, a movie-novelization that is almost as good as &#34;Midworld&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;Plain Putrid: This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak.&#39;,
 &#39;Can I shoot myself now??: A few years back I was forced to read &#34;Tess&#34; for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on &#34;Tess..&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Awful: This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.&#39;,
 &#34;Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess&#39;s virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.&#34;,
 &#34;The book was boring, because of its victorian ideals.: Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book&#39;s major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book. It is the same thing with the Scarlet Letter, to enjoy the book you must know about the time era. The problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards.&#34;,
 &#39;Obligatory: My kindle is making me do this...One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen&#39;,
 &#39;Good Companion Piece: I read this book soon after I had seen the A&amp;E mini-series. Reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialect(s) Hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher. Very good book overall.&#39;,
 &#39;Great classic: I remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again. I had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following Tess through her trials and tribulations, albeit some self imposed.&#39;,
 &#34;Beautifully written, dark Masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl.: A beautifully written, dark masterpiece about an unforgetable Victorian girl. Her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor, unable to fulfill his obligations. Tess takes his place and, through a series of misfortunes, is sent away to rich &#39;relatives&#39; with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family. She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again. It&#39;s a beautiful love story, and so much more. Highly recommended!&#34;,
 &#34;I hated this book then....: ...and hate it now. My only revenge for being forced to read Tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult. So there, that&#39;s done.&#34;,
 &#34;Bad purchace.: Well I thought I was getting the student edition, but I got the Instructor&#39;s edition. I guess I&#39;ll have to go back to B&amp;N.&#34;,
 &#34;Ummm: I have been using this for several months now and I am not particularly impressed by it. The liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything to/for my skin. Jury&#39;s sill out for me...&#34;,
 &#39;Science Fact Empowers Science Fiction: Mars Rising is the best documentary I\&#39;ve ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner\&#39;s voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the &#34;manned mission to Mars&#34; genre.&#39;,
 &#34;Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable: In an Age of Communist Oppression, we see a side of Daniel Day-Lewis reminiscent of the lovable letch &#39;Newland&#39; in The Age of Innocence. Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It&#39;s amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas&#39; wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it&#39;s Tomas&#39; decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie.&#34;,
 &#39;Please read Kundera\&#39;s book instead: Kundera\&#39;s novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera\&#39;s book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera\&#39;s novel, because it is wonderful. I can\&#39;t help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: &#34;The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Sad Yet Beautiful: The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film, but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine, who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate, and cannot change her feelings. This film explores the difference between the two, and the pain that one causes the other by his &#34;lightness of being&#34;.Towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker, so be ready to cry your eyes out.&#39;,
 &#39;Milan Kundera rides again...: A wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives... Read the book, too. Not for the shallow-minded.&#39;,
 &#39;Lacking: The movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book. I told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me. Big mistake. In the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes. In the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations. Void of philosophy and psychology.&#39;,
 &#39;The Unbearable Length of Worker &amp; Parasite (End Spoiler): Basically, it goes like this, Eastern European intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex. At the end, of what seems frigging hours and hours of self-loathing, when they finally find happiness, they all die in a truck accident.&#39;,
 &#39;disappointed: I have been very impressed by other &#34;pickin on&#34; music: Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zep, Santana, to name a few I have. However, Hendrix music did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style, it was a great disappointment, and this is one CD I will get rid of quickly.&#39;,
 &#39;The birth of Drone??: As far as I know,this predates anything else known as &#34;drone&#34; music,which seems to be a popular genre these days.This is about as psychedelic as it gets,your mind wandering out into the infinite void.So good.&#39;,
 &#34;Short stories with a message: Living In Chaos Is Living In Stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting. This book is personal in that it is about peoples&#39; private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody. Whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life, something drastic can happen and change your world around. The stories are touching, yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of life.I would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life.&#34;,
 &#34;Fantastic products - great way to try them all!: I try everything new, hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes (and I&#39;m only 36!) --Anyway, when I read about rice bran, I thought why not - this brand contains a lot of rice bran - it&#39;s like the 2nd ingredient in everything after water, and there is nothing else in it I couldn&#39;t pronounce. The stuff smells great, and goes on non-greasy, especially the face cream it&#39;s like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in. The TrueRenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients, and insturctions (the packages are written in Japanese so you need to read their instructions) - and I even got a free gift of green tea - yum!&#34;,
 &#39;Amazingly soft hair!: I have been looking for an all natural shampoo, and this is a wonderful one. It made my hair incredibly soft with tons of body--I was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair. The sample is worth the price just to test it out.&#39;,
 &#39;Prose-Poetry to inspire: I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you\&#39;re an artist. I read &#34;On The Road&#34;, &#34;The Town and The City&#34;, and just before this one, &#34;The Subterraneans&#34;, which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long ! This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down. If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer.&#39;,
 &#34;On the Road To Enlightenment: Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac&#39;s most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective. Lots of meditation, soul searching and existential ruminations about life, truth, and nature. My only regret is that I didn&#39;t choose the book format, as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car.&#34;,
 &#34;Flat Kerouac: I&#39;m amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It&#39;s Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you&#39;ve already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz&#39;s Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written.&#34;,
 &#39;Self Indulgent Nonsense: The operative word from the title is &#34;bums&#34;. This is a book about them and their self indulgent, self righteous idleness. A work with no redeeming features.&#39;,
 &#39;Outlines of Theology, AA Hodge: Kindle edition: Very disappointed. The book is a great work, but there are so many unreadable words in the Kindle e-book edition that after a few pages of frustration, you finally give up trying. This product should either be taken off the availablity or corrected for errors so it becomes readable.&#39;,
 &#34;Life changing!: This book has changed my life. It opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery. I&#39;m want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.&#34;,
 &#39;not worth it: mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.&#39;,
 &#39;WAIT FOR THE BETTER DVD COMBO!! So dissapointing!: I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it, and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras!&#39;,
 &#39;Not really a good movie: This film is like a teenager with short attention span. Storytelling is like facebooking.Too many plots to cover, horrible pacing, no depth.&#39;,
 &#39;transformers: The 3d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better. This movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.&#39;,
 &#34;Loved It!: I&#39;m an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn&#39;t slow thing for me. I&#39;ve watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!&#34;,
 &#39;Transformers: Dark of the moon: All I can say is AWESOME, the family loved it and was so very HAPPY to watch and enjoy on a great family evening, Thanks Bunches!&#39;,
 &#39;TRANFORMERS DARK OF THE MOON: transformers dark of the moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation&#39;,
 &#34;1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness: When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people&#39;s childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the &#39;86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I&#39;m not talking Pink Floyd).&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah: I mean, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one. Came quickly, shipped well, no problems...except the film itself...just....bad.&#39;,
 &#39;Please, if this is the way this franchise is going... STOP!: This rated as one of the worst movies that I have ever see. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Unless you are a devoted Transformers Fan that must see or have all things Transformers stay away from this movie.&#39;,
 &#34;instant video is mislabeling it&#39;s movies as 3d: I did a search for 3d movies on Amazon instant video and this movie came up, but when I purchased it I was disapointed to see that it wasn&#39;t 3d. I am writing this review without watching more than 5 minutes of the movie so it&#39;s not that the movie is bad. Amazon needs to re-label their 3d movie selection.&#34;,
 &#34;Another &#39;video game&#39; type of movie, Whyyy?: Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!&#34;,
 &#39;Great eye candy, but compares poorly to the first one: No surprises left, and a highly predictable plot. But great action scenes and spectacular special effects. Tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode, but lacks the suspense and drama. My 8 years olds got a kick out of it. I got bored.&#39;,
 &#39;Horrible: Absolutely rubbish. Would not feed this film to a dog. Simply not good by any measure. You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.&#39;,
 &#39;Transformers: Dark of the Moon: By most accounts, the Michael Bay-directed Transformers films to date are not very good, but that hasn\&#39;t stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash, and this third installment, Dark of the Moon, made the most of them all. This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren\&#39;t exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don\&#39;t expect to find much more to the movie than &#34;Ooh, big robots and explosions!&#34; But hey, for some, that\&#39;s really all you need.&#39;,
 &#34;The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.: The movie wouldn&#39;t play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn&#39;t fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon&#39;s customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I&#39;ve had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck.&#34;,
 &#34;The perfect movie, for a 12 yr old: I gave it one star because the website doesn&#39;t allow it to go any lower, and, for all the effort put in by the computer animation team. Other than that, this movie should be negative 1 star.The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth&#39;s atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?There&#39;s literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things. Besides that, please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra 2 hours of your life.&#34;,
 &#39;Lights out on this awful film: I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen\&#39;s bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as &#34;immature&#34; as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It\&#39;s an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It\&#39;s clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It\&#39;s not his forté and hasn\&#39;t been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection.&#39;,
 &#39;Not that great: The first transformers movie will always be the best one, and its just ok. The movies too long jumping back and forth, very poorly constructed.&#39;,
 &#39;Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12: I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description.&#39;,
 &#39;Love this movie: Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.&#39;,
 &#39;Could have been MUCH better and shorter: The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie.&#39;,
 &#34;Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon: This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie. It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots. Only beef is that it&#39;s language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens. Overall, excellent for adults and recommended.&#34;,
 &#39;Transformers Dark of the Moon: A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.&#39;,
 &#39;Movie is ok, but..................: the title of the disk pack is totally wrong.It should be Blue Ray + DVD and digital copy available for DLa 210gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it, to me is lame.you enter a very long url, then input the code and start the download managerafter it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie, and get a error 404 website not foundI can get to any other web site I enter, but not to the Transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site cannot be accessed.Paramount should take lessons from Fox on how to include the digital copy&#39;,
 &#39;Guys Movie: So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there.&#39;,
 &#34;Never thought I&#39;d miss Megan Fox!: I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn&#39;t stand Sam&#39;s new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There&#39;s foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they&#39;re going to be taking refuge in a glass building. What could possibly go wrong?&#34;,
 &#39;Transformers: Dark of the Moon: watched this one and the previous one several times. Like this movie lots and so did the kids! thanks so much&#39;,
 &#34;Thought transformers suppose to be for kids....: I know a lot of movies aren&#39;t going to be kid friendly. That you will have to fast forward past some things. But Transformers, that advertise a kids theme, sold as toys at stores, can be find in MacDonald happy meals. So you would think the movie be for kids. But it not. They focus more on Sam and love gal then what the robots story. Forget Sam, the name of the movie is TRANSFORMERS.I rate this movie 1star...love the CGI for the robots. But you barley seen the robots. The whole movies is about Sam and his love interest. Michael Bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about TRANSFORMERS...pitiful&#34;,
 &#39;Safety pins: As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me. I threw them in the trash&#39;,
 &#39;Bad Movie By A Bad Wrestler: Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan!&#39;,
 &#34;B-Movie-Licious: I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised, and a little disappointed in my own taste, but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions, Fighting...and that&#39;s it. Luckily, it delivers both of those in spades, especially the &#39;splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion&#39;s share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he&#39;s a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though.&#34;,
 &#34;Hell no.: Might actually watch this if Cena wasn&#39;t in it, if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movie.*Update:Marine II will star Ted Dibease HAHAHAHAHAHAH LOL!!!! pathetic.&#34;,
 &#39;What a complete and utter waste of time, and money.: This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible,the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable,and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy. First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback. No story what so ever. The car chase scene is so full of it, a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around. Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out. Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ....&#39;,
 &#34;Please Listen to Me...Don&#39;t buy this product!: I&#39;ve had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I&#39;d give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony (who didn&#39;t even know what the emarker was) for over four hours, I still can&#39;t the thing to work. There&#39;s some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can&#39;t use it at all. If I were you, I&#39;d wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)As for me, I plan on returning my emarker today.&#34;,
 &#34;Sony E-Marker is now obsolete: Excellent Product, but Sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of Sept so don&#39;t bother buying. Shame as it was really good while it lasted.&#34;,
 &#34;good idea, good looks, needs lots of work: I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it&#39;s sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.&#34;,
 &#39;Totally Useless: I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless.&#39;,
 &#39;worthless: Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to &#34;enable&#34; itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work.&#39;,
 &#34;Another thingabob on a key chain: E-marker started to lose it&#39;s appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn&#39;t constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it&#39;s potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.&#34;,
 &#34;Sony has pulled the plug: Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don&#39;t buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them.&#34;,
 &#39;Worthless: Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy this Junk: Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn&#39;t work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can&#39;t be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk.&#34;,
 &#34;Artwork???: Did the National Socialists require censorship here or something? The new artwork isn&#39;t even scary... WTF You&#39;ve ruined a classic. No one buy this BS.&#34;,
 &#34;Absolutely ruined it.: As a child I would stare at the Gammell&#39;s illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don&#39;t buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid, that I am actually going to write a letter (ON PAPER! with a stamp!!) to Harper Collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person. Jeez. Absolutely terrible, the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;I Can Read&#34; book has better illustrations: While the stories in the &#34;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark&#34; book remain the same, the Stephen Gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candy-coated pictures.How candy-coated? Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, &#34;In A Dark, Dark Room&#34;, which was written for Level 2 of the &#34;I Can Read!&#34; children\&#39;s collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of &#34;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;The description said Stephen Gammell as artist and it was not...: I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the &#34;scary&#34; trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist. I am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork. This is the first time I\&#39;ve been disappointed with an order from Amazon, but it\&#39;s a big one. You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator.&#39;,
 &#39;Disappointed: This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to &#34;freestyle&#34; and &#34;improvisation&#34;. I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I\&#39;m now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it\&#39;s been a week, and I\&#39;m already seeking out another video to buy.&#39;,
 &#34;Tongue hurt my ankle: The shoe seemed nice. I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight. Unfortunately, the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe. Didn&#39;t matter which sock I wore. I had to return.&#34;,
 &#39;Buy the 1993 version instead.: I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author. That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive &#34;pamphlet&#34; (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren\&#39;t enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere.&#39;,
 &#39;Protection Advice: All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes. Men are usually stronger &amp; larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity. I purchased these books as gifts for the women I care about, as a guide which points them in the correct direction.&#39;,
 &#39;know the source of your information: While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive.&#39;,
 &#39;Great movie and terrific views of the Dingle peninsula.: We visited the Dingle peninsula of Ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there. Turns out that, in addition to having great scenes of the Dingle countryside, it also has a very good story line. And, terrific acting and some Irish history thrown in for good measure.&#39;,
 &#39;Viewed it yesterday: This movie would make a great opera adaptation. Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?&#39;,
 &#34;Ryan&#39;s Revenge: A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I&#39;ll be kind, it&#39;s not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean.&#34;,
 &#39;Excellant movie and seller: I saw this movie when it first came out, it was hauntingly beautiful. I am so happy to get it on DVD. Some may find it a little slow in areas, but I loved it. If you appreciate the work of David Lean, and the acting of Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum, then you will love this. It ranks right up there for me with Dr. Zhivago, which I also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen. A wonderful epic movie. The seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though I was buying from a friend. Way to do business!!&#39;,
 &#39;it sounds great!~!~!~!~!: it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a very reliable printer...: I love my PhotoSmart 1215 but was a little discouraged when the driver for XP was not available. The neat thing about this printer is, if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card, you don&#39;t have to be connected to your PC. Just know which numbers you want to print, enter and off it goes. The quality of my prints has been great. Right now it&#39;s connected to my iMac and is doing splendidly. It&#39;s quite dependable and not expensive. I&#39;d recommend it highly.*****&#34;,
 &#34;Grindhouse?: I guess I&#39;m not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse. One would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure. They were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the 1950s proud.&#34;,
 &#34;Am I missing something?: Sorry about the 1-star rating -- it is not for the book&#39;s content (I can&#39;t read it), but for the horrible way it displays on my iPad.The cover page is nice and big, fills the screen, and looks great. Ever subsequent page however is about half size, meaning that two pages fit across the iPad screen, and the font is too small to be readable.Furthermore, the iPad version only allows landscape viewing, and the stupid Kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list, and moving on to another book.Am I missing something here?&#34;,
 &#39;Is honesty always rewarded ?: Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty, terrorism, and thievery and focus on resourcefulness, first impressions, and survival. Fred Marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time. Wish he had a website!&#39;,
 &#39;LOVE THIS BOOK: I read this entire book from front to back in 1 day. IT WAS GREAT. Full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not&#39;,
 &#34;Awesome if not overplayed: The first 5 songs are incredible, and the rest are OK. I live in France and Chumbawamba never got really big there so I haven&#39;t heard tubthumping a zillion times, which makes it still interesting to listen to.&#34;,
 &#39;A Great CD for all people: I got this CD about a year and a half ago and I still listen to it. It is a very good CD with about 5 good dance tracks. Plus, the trumpet playing is great! I also liked on how smoothly the music and the vocals came together. This is truly a masterpiece&#39;,
 &#39;Beyond the mega-hit, preview of better things to come: Besides the much maligned mega-hit &#34;Tubthumping&#34; which I didn\&#39;t like when it was first released but like now, this is a solid CD with great arrangements, lyrics, and performances. It\&#39;s not perfect but how many CD\&#39;s are perfect these days? I have recently discovered &#34;Ready Mades and Then Some&#34; - clearly a 5-star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song. Masterfully done. I won\&#39;t write a song-by-song critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that. However, I do put forward a challenge to &#34;rtbarry&#34; in AZ to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a &#34;review&#34;, if he is capable, to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this CD that rates it only one star? Or, does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were Kim Jong-il of North Korea? Otherwise, &#34;rtbarry&#34; don\&#39;t waste our time with drivel.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s Great!: This is really a great CD. Chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts. you just have to understand them.&#34;,
 &#39;The One Star: The one star is for the only ONE good song on this cd. Tubthumping...Actually, this song blows after you hear it more than 5 times. This cd has only been in my cd player once...That is the day i bought it. If you like wasting money, buy this cd.&#39;,
 &#39;I won\&#39;t buy one again: I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in &#34;best&#34; quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I\&#39;ve down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!&#39;,
 &#39;Non Computer Geek: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER, I have had a Hp 1100 and had moderate success with it, after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix, I just got this printer and it is even worse, it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box, the copy was consistantly misaligned. I am sending it back.&#39;,
 &#39;Curved Thomas the Train tracks: Again, a good product, but over priced. I would try to find some gently used ones.&#39;,
 &#34;O-o-okay: Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then, this whiny main character that, regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove Sabin is an honest, honorable man, she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way. Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn&#39;t deserve a man like Sabin. Lastly, to top it all off, after she&#39;s unloaded abuse after abuse on him, he simply tells her he&#39;s a good guy and she&#39;s like, oh, well, in that case I believe you and I love you. How utterly stupid! His actions obviously mean nothing, but she&#39;ll listen to what he says--wham--bam!Terrible, just terrible!&#34;,
 &#34;Heads above the first book in the trilogy: I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I&#39;ve been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn&#39;t believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book.&#34;,
 &#34;Good book: I liked this book. I don&#39;t really have anything profound to say, I&#39;m only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov&#39;s fictional Galactic history.&#34;,
 &#34;Fantastic Sci Fi Classic: The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite. The story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections, which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat. Can&#39;t recommend this series highly enough for any SciFi fan.&#34;,
 &#34;Phenomenal: I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth&#39;s future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change.&#34;,
 &#39;Good politics, but no science: The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction.&#39;,
 &#34;Asimow is one of the best writers of all times: Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don&#39;t want to read all the books of the series, you don&#39;t have to do it, the saga of foundation it&#39;s only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won&#39;t regret it. I really loved all this books.&#34;,
 &#34;Classic: Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn&#39;t tell.....I am a fan!&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t Bother: Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However, you should stop there. Foundation is bad. This book is totally predictable. Read DUNE if you want something intelligent and entertaining. Read FOUNDATION if you want something that you probably won&#39;t even finish.&#34;,
 &#34;tough going: I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that&#39;s just one of the series!&#34;,
 &#39;Dissatified: I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story.&#39;,
 &#39;Goes &#34;Haywire&#34; Regularly: Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I\&#39;m off to buy an Epson!&#39;,
 &#39;Old fashioned, sweet story.: Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it just the same. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it.&#39;,
 &#39;Stay Away: This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.&#39;,
 &#39;worst.........movie............ever: Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!&#39;,
 &#39;Blu-Ray Review: What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2.&#39;,
 &#34;LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!: There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn&#39;t figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!&#34;,
 &#34;What did I watch?: So he&#39;s a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don&#39;t know why I continued to watch.&#34;,
 &#34;Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there&#39;s more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?&#34;,
 &#39;If you can\&#39;t make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I\&#39;m so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (&#34;Welcome to Mongolia!&#34; is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book.&#39;,
 &#39;Banal and Boring: No, I\&#39;m not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say &#34;nearly,&#34; because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I\&#39;m not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable...&#39;,
 &#39;GREAT ITEM: I find this item to be more than expectedand I think everyone should consider buying oneI will tell everyone about it&#39;,
 &#34;Amazing Score.: Wow, words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece. First I will start with the movie, brilliant! That is all there is to be said about the film. Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild&#39;s work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!&#34;,
 &#34;Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don&#39;t get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it.&#34;,
 &#39;Brio Medium straight track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set. My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s too simple even for a KISS book: I know the whole point of &#34;dummie&#34; and &#34;KISS&#34; books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn\&#39;t gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste.&#39;,
 &#39;Quality from Tripp Lite as always: I always goes with the Trip Lite fiber patch cables, due to their quality, and not being so proud of their name they triple the price.&#39;,
 &#34;awful: Big waste of money! After washing noticed 1 pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what I&#39;ve tried. Stuck with it since I washed and can&#39;t find packaging.&#34;,
 &#34;Good grill for the money.: I&#39;ve been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill. I&#39;ve used it to grill steaks, duck breasts, veggies, and chicken. Takes longer than a gas grill, but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen.&#34;,
 &#39;Excessive Typos Ruined it for Me: Couldn\&#39;t agree more w/ Prendergast\&#39;s review concerning the laughable typos. I thought the proof reader or editor of the version I had must be abusing drugs themselves! How distracting to read a so called &#34;classic&#34; and find it reading like a HS sophomore paper - and a drunk sophomore at that! I somehow managed to finish the book, but came on Amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version. Weird. Typos, poor punctuation, etc. ruined it for me.&#39;,
 &#39;entertaining action movie SPOILERS: the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.&#39;,
 &#34;one more positive note: Don&#39;t know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author&#39;s comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well.&#34;,
 &#34;Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound: Don&#39;t buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they&#39;ll get a clue.&#34;,
 &#39;This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980\&#39;s: This is probably Mel Gibson\&#39;s first film. A film he\&#39;s done while he was in his 20\&#39;s. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as &#34;The Road Warrior.&#34; And &#34;The Road Warrior&#34; is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980\&#39;s.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.&#34;Mad Max&#34; is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the &#34;action hero&#34; dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.&#39;,
 &#34;Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I&#39;ve seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there&#39;s a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan &amp; scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you&#39;ve seen this movie in the past and thought, &#39;It was OK&#39; this new DVD will have you saying, &#39;It was great!&#39;&#34;,
 &#39;AWFUL: This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, my God! It\&#39;s Stereolab!!!: Ever since I got this album since last summer, I kept on thinking what this album will sound like. I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles\&#39; eerie song &#34;Revolution 9&#34; from the &#34;White Album.&#34; I could\&#39;ve just imagined while listening to &#34;Baby Lulu&#34; and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I\&#39;ve ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you\&#39;re at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)&#39;,
 &#34;Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel&#39;s wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don&#39;t reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!&#34;,
 &#39;Great kids movie: The Kids loved this movie Martin Short is hillarious. The fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.&#39;,
 &#39;Funny: This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording &amp; prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.&#39;,
 &#34;Well Played Kid&#39;s Music: Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it&#39;s own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won&#39;t drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own.&#34;,
 &#34;Highway Robbery: It always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here. You can bet I&#39;ll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!&#34;,
 &#34;well....: i also really loved the book. it showed two strong willed people who are, at first glance, totally wrong for each other! i mean, a centuries old vampire, and a vampire slayer? it was ironic! i also liked that even though Quin was a cold fish on the outside, inside he was just as lonely as Rashel, even if he rarely admitted it. i loved the book and couldn&#39;t put it down! if u haven&#39;t read it yet, do so!&#34;,
 &#39;Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.&#39;,
 &#39;Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual &#34;guide.&#34; The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it\&#39;s pretty easy to determine where each piece connects. We are happy customers!&#39;,
 &#39;These Shoes are made for walking.: In the Merrill way these are great shoes. As my daughter says, &#34;Merrills are a hug for the feet.&#34; Even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable. These go everywhere! I love them.&#39;,
 &#34;Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I&#39;ve read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America&#39;s relations to it.&#34;,
 &#34;Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer&#39;s masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet&#39;s Carmen and a small handful of others, I&#39;m not a great opera fan but Schreker&#39;s output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.&#34;,
 &#39;Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3/ 256 PC133 256MB 32MX64: Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc. In a few seconds I was up and running and my pc working much faster that before&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ll enjoy this CD: I got a huge kick out of Vinny&#39;s interpretations of the Beatles&#39; songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don&#39;t mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It&#39;s light and it&#39;s fun. It&#39;s is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you&#39;ll get a big kick out of this disc.&#34;,
 &#39;Madonna is a great singer: Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of &#34;Lament&#34; it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song &#34;Beuonos Aires&#34; she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less.&#39;,
 &#34;EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas&#39;s accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.&#34;,
 &#34;Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP&#39;s support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also.&#34;,
 &#39;A text book worth keeping for reference: This is a text book that I will not be selling back! I like the reference style set-up, with tabbed pages. I am sure I will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses.&#39;,
 &#34;A small leak, right out of the box: I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn&#39;t take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this.&#34;,
 &#34;Did not last long: We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it&#39;s inflated height. There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress, not compact but less risky than an airbed.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a great value!: I purchased a twin size Intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that I ordered a second. It was easy to inflate, held it&#39;s firmness, was VERY easy to take down and easily stored. Now when my granddaughters come to visit, they have their own bed and great pajama parties.&#34;,
 &#34;Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item, and it&#39;s a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it&#39;s like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store.&#34;,
 &#39;comfortable sleep: I found this air bed to be perfect for 1 person. The ease in filling, the height, all exceptional!I would reccomend this bed to anyone.&#39;,
 &#39;Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.&#39;,
 &#39;Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!&#39;,
 &#39;Intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump: Excellent value for the money. Convenient and comfortable, I just wish it was a little higher. I would recommend this product.&#39;,
 &#39;Do Not Buy: Inflates like a charm, then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours, I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have (queen) has worked for &gt; 7 years.&#39;,
 &#39;It would be great if it stayed inflated!: I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress.&#39;,
 &#34;Valve broke after a couple of uses: My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won&#39;t close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can&#39;t inflate the mattress. Very poor quality.&#34;,
 &#39;Ecelente producto: Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo.&#39;,
 &#34;WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN: THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON&#39;S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM.&#34;,
 &#39;Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We\&#39;ve had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I\&#39;m very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it\&#39;s clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is &#34;save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on&#34;, that\&#39;s what we\&#39;re doing now.&#39;,
 &#39;Comfortable: I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all, NO LEAKING!!!&#39;,
 &#34;Disappointed but shouldn&#39;t be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there&#39;s hope.&#34;,
 &#39;Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.&#39;,
 &#34;Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I&#39;m sure it will be used again.&#34;,
 &#34;Quick and Easy: This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don&#39;t have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump.&#34;,
 &#34;Love it: We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town, they took my oldest sons room. We needed something for him to sleep on but didn&#39;t have much room. This twin airbed by Intex is great! I love the fact that the pump is built in. It doesn&#39;t get in the way like I thought it might. My son says it&#39;s very comfortable. It&#39;s easy to inflate and deflate.&#34;,
 &#34;Great Find at a Great Price: I needed to replace my airbed but didn&#39;t want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.&#34;,
 &#39;Its better then a &#34;normal&#34; bed: I just moved out of my moms house and I did\&#39;nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I\&#39;m still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud.&#39;,
 &#39;Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent product for the price: Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy.&#39;,
 &#39;great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.&#39;,
 &#34;Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn&#39;t think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#34;Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!: I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can&#39;t use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night.&#34;,
 &#34;The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!: I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone&#39;s place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself&#34;,
 &#39;Fantastic: Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick, quiet and easy. Deflation works the same. Slight loss of air by early morning. Fits back into tote nicely, take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric, fold in thirds length wise, then role from bottom toward pump/pillow end. Easy to tote and store.&#39;,
 &#34;Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you&#39;re looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!&#34;,
 &#39;Step\&#39;s Best Work So Far!: I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD &#34;Standing Room Only.&#34; &#34;I\&#39;m So Glad&#34; has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a &#34;must buy&#34; for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year.&#39;,
 &#34;200 bucks?: I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways, The case doesn&#39;t get the best air so I&#39;d recommend getting more fans.If you have problems with the front USB hubs (pc freezes when you plug something in them), unplug the very BOTTOM black wire.[r|r][w|w][g|g][b|b][b|[]&#34;,
 &#39;DVD review: Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.&#39;,
 &#34;Not worth the money: Not what I thought I was getting. I don&#39;t think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.&#34;,
 &#39;good: It was good, is not like out of this world and really amazing, but it works soooooo good! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it, it turns off automatically, that sucks!&#39;,
 &#39;Too Expensive: I used it once and have not touched it since, the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft, Waste of MONEY&#39;,
 &#39;No way!: This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.&#39;,
 &#34;Not worth the money: What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that&#39;s the part that goes on you clit. I&#39;m almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I&#39;ve tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money.&#34;,
 &#34;GREAT prodct: For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I&#39;ve never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It&#39;s a little large, and kinda hard but that&#39;s okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.&#34;,
 &#39;Awful: This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product.&#39;,
 &#34;Too big!: While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don&#39;t think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.&#34;,
 &#39;Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the &#34;bunny ears&#34; cause more pain than pleasure. I don\&#39;t recommend this product.&#39;,
 &#39;HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!&#39;,
 &#39;Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn\&#39;t jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum &#34;my first vibrator&#34; hahaha!It\&#39;s really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more &#34;lifted&#34; off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!&#39;,
 &#34;After 6 years, this album is still awesome.: This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You&#39;ll definitely get your money&#39;s worth from this album. And even though it&#39;s over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It&#39;s pretty, but I don&#39;t expect it to hold up.&#34;,
 &#39;Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.&#39;,
 &#39;Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD\&#39;s) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her &#34;dialouges&#34; between songs (her words &amp; messages are invaluble &amp; timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like &#34;Evergreen&#34; (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), &#34;The Music of the Night&#34; , &amp; &#34;Somewhere&#34; (not favorable with Il Divo)&#39;,
 &#39;Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter...&#39;,
 &#39;misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the &#34;too good to be true&#34; price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.&#39;,
 &#34;Waste of money: If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I&#39;m forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!&#34;,
 &#39;What a waste!: After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.&#39;,
 &#39;Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!: Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that\&#39;s all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can\&#39;t see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 &#34;generations&#34; older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.&#39;,
 &#34;Confused: I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I&#39;ve tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first.&#34;,
 &#34;Great deliver of all products: Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don&#39;t know how they were liked.&#34;,
 &#34;Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story: Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn&#39;t have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh Romeo: Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.&#39;,
 &#34;A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn&#39;t like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn&#39;t already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it&#39;s beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.&#34;,
 &#34;RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn&#39;t for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn&#39;t understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!&#34;,
 &#34;Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It&#39;s great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version.&#34;,
 &#34;How do films like this get made?: If this isn&#39;t the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That&#39;s it!&#34;,
 &#34;What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer&#39;s uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don&#39;t get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!&#34;,
 &#34;Cute, But a Little Cheap...: This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don&#39;t really like it, myself. I think it could be better.&#34;,
 &#34;Disappointed: I&#39;m glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can&#39;t choose my color I don&#39;t want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn&#39;t lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!&#34;,
 &#34;no color, no buy: I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I&#39;d end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!&#34;,
 &#34;Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello&#39;s other albums and, in my opinion, doesn&#39;t hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey&#39;s style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!&#34;,
 &#39;Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter\&#39;s pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? &#34;Mom - it\&#39;s really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!&#34;I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library\&#39;s collection! (I won\&#39;t....I\&#39;ll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg\&#39;s out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won\&#39;t give it 5 stars any more!&#39;,
 &#39;A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren\&#39;t really Manson &#34;in his own words&#34; but were nothing more than fabrication.&#39;,
 &#39;MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,&#34;Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he\&#39;s milked you for two books.. he\&#39;s a good crook.&#34;The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual.&#39;,
 &#34;Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie&#39;s own words, you&#39;re mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his &#39;friend&#39;. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don&#39;t buy it.&#34;,
 &#39;REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!: DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said &#34;man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system&#34; even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#39;,
 &#34;I couldn&#39;t put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn&#39;t put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.&#34;,
 &#34;sadly predictable: If you don&#39;t like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don&#39;t mind the writer&#39;s technique or don&#39;t see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.&#34;,
 &#39;Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!&#39;,
 &#39;Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However &#34;Hope&#34; is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.&#39;,
 &#39;A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.&#39;,
 &#39;A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science &amp; plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex &amp; the universe captivating.&#39;,
 &#39;One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing &#34;object&#34; and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read&#39;,
 &#34;GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price: Love the book, love dealing with Amazon.com I&#39;ve been dealing with Amazon for years now, and have never had a problem with them. THANKS ONCE AGAIN AMAZON.&#34;,
 &#39;Great space heater!: It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it.&#39;,
 &#39;Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of &#34;Portrait of a Marriage&#34; years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA\&#39;s library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call &#34;The Three V\&#39;s.&#34; The three V\&#39;s are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.&#39;,
 &#34;Buyer Beware!!: If I&#39;d only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn&#39;t from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!&#34;,
 &#34;This will be an additional toy for next spring&#39;s yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn&#39;t wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don&#39;t...you&#39;ll save your self some money and frustration.&#34;,
 &#39;Worst scanner I\&#39;ve owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I\&#39;ve ever worked with. The &#34;auto&#34; buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.&#39;,
 &#39;a childhood favorite: In &#34;The Greengage Summer&#34; five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.&#39;,
 &#34;Forget Belkin, look no further than the GUF320: This thing was easy to intall. I have a Dual 1.25 G4 Mac. No driver installations under Panther 10.3.3. If you&#39;re pre 10.2.X on a Mac you&#39;ll have to visit Iogear&#39;s website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn&#39;t have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market.&#34;,
 &#39;Great Book: For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book&#39;,
 &#39;Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the &#34;natural disaster&#34; ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character\&#39;s individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too&#39;,
 &#39;Afghan lovers unite: This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts, I had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos. I recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy.&#39;,
 &#39;complete nuisance: I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box.&#39;,
 &#39;bad company: The scanner looks nice but very deceiving, I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets, now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit. (Bad company)&#39;,
 &#39;does not work: You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?&#39;,
 &#34;Decent player... while it lasts: After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative&#39;s players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn&#39;t expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.&#34;,
 &#39;Poor substitute for an iPod: Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap.&#39;,
 &#39;Yet another broken headphone jack.: After roughly a year of fairly reliable use, I\&#39;ve also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack. Now i\&#39;m wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (&#34;limited&#34; being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider &#34;fixing&#34;, and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would\&#39;ve given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I\&#39;m outright angry that I\&#39;m not alone.&#39;,
 &#39;Discontinued 70PD05500032?: Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don\&#39;t have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as &#34;Discontinued&#34;. It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs\&#39; own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.&#39;,
 &#34;Top Notch Christmas Jazz: I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD&#39;s. How did I miss this one for so long? It&#39;s a winner from begining to end. The Trio really delivers some tasty versions of your favorite Christmas standards. Each nugget features a unique take on the song without straying too far from the original sound. Very upbeat and lively thtoughout. Not your standard, elevator jazz.&#34;,
 &#39;review: The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy, hard to follow.&#39;,
 &#39;Wow: I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon\&#39;s rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson\&#39;s involvment with Manson. That\&#39;s just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: &#34;Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)&#34;.I\&#39;ve seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD.&#39;,
 &#39;Basketball, not at its best: Ok, as yall might know me, im Gamer8. To the game. This game is sorta like the first NBA Street game for the PS2. It has some flaws, such as lighting. Also, at points of the game, you might say, is this game worth $50.00? Well, its worth about $30.00. 1.- Its not a good game for portability. 2.- Lighting is bad at times 3.-Can be hard for beginners. So I suggest that you must know what the first few NBA Street games are about before buying thsi title. PS:Its a fun game after a while&#39;,
 &#34;never again: I bought this heater and it didn&#39;t even work on arrival. The pilot light came on, but nothing else. What a waste of time and money.&#34;,
 &#39;Reaching for the Light: I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!&#39;,
 &#39;Hardly worth reading: This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read.&#39;,
 &#39;Statin levels: Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins, (Icluding monacolins KA form).The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label. They want everyone reliant on large pharma. This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption.&#39;,
 &#39;DECEPCIONADO: Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería &#34;el libro&#34; para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil, lo primero que leí fue lo referente a estoa paises. QUE DECEPCIÓN!La idea del libro es excelente y seguramente la autora tuvo que viajar, leer y estudiar mucho, pero pienso que debió haber pedido ayuda a que revisaran sus capítulos personas conocedoras de cada país o región.Tiene muchos errores históricos, geográficos, culinarios y de ortografía del idioma original. Estoy preparando una lista de ellos que posteriormente enviaré.La felicito por su dedicación, perodes graciadamente el resultado no es del todo bueno.Hans Rio de Janeiro/Brasil&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent show, poor sound: Unfortunatelly the DVD is dissapointing for Tina\&#39;s fans. The show is fantastic, but both Dolby Digital and DTS version of this DVD have one of the worst sounds I ever heard. My subwoofer didn\&#39;t move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames. More, the soundtrack was re-edited with sound taken from other concerts (that\&#39;s incredible - at one moment I swear that I heard the word Munchen despite the fact that the concert is in Amsterdam). And, oh yes, the DVD is overpriced. Forget &#34;Amsterdam&#34; and don\&#39;t miss &#34;One Last Time in Concert&#34; as it has verry good sound quality and image. Not speaking abut the phantastic show...&#39;,
 &#39;Northwinds - \&#39;Great God Pan\&#39; (Black Widow): Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work,but I\&#39;ll try.A French progressive outfit that blends old school Sabbath with celtic music.Would that formula even fly?It does here.Notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on \&#39;Great...\&#39;.A total of six cuts,with each one averaging eight minutes.Tunes I couldn\&#39;t get enough of were the title track,&#34;Great God Pan&#34;,their Sabbath cover of &#34;A National Acrobat&#34;(talk about covering an obscurity-great work!!)and the epic &#34;The Forest Of Koncerei&#34;.A real keeper.&#39;,
 &#34;It does not use your classification for the musics.: I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven&#39;t bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don&#39;t want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device.&#34;,
 &#39;Returned the View twice in one week: I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems.&#39;,
 &#39;Worst mp3 player on the market.: I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product. This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life. I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please, please do not waste your money &amp; time on this product. I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it.&#39;,
 &#34;Nice Device: This is a nice MP3. I got it on Black Friday on Amazon for only $99.99 , yes Sansa View 8 GB MP3 280. While everyone else was looking at the lighting rounds on Black Friday they didn&#39;t see the tiny small icons around the today&#39;s deal page. If you use a computer you should be able to tranfer sound &amp; images files without using a program. It&#39;s basic computer 101. I use Sony&#39;s SonicStage myself. Records at 192 for crisp sound.&#34;,
 &#34;This player is very very good: Wow, this has been one of the best products I bought, with great sound, great quality pictures in the video, easy to load files into memory, compatible with WMP, it also brings a player-Sync in the installation cd . I like, I take all Pareto, I plug in the car, sounds very hard, is extremely friendly to navigate between playlists. Presntacion has several languages&#39;&#39;. The Spanish translation used is very good and relevant, unlike others who say one thing and mean another. I recommend&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy without a good return policy.: This player freezes constantly. It&#39;s possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don&#39;t buy without a good return policy.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy this piece of crap: I bought this piece of crap and found out it&#39;s not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So, I have basically a $200 radio. Worthless. DO NOT BUY!!!&#34;,
 &#39;Nothing is from scratch?: Why on Earth would &#34;nothing is made from scratch&#34; be a selling point for a cookbook? How horrid!For good, simple cooking, look into Mark Bittman\&#39;s cookbooks.&#39;,
 &#39;Really funny and exciting: I\&#39;d say this book is extremely informative for the responsible, occasional sit at home drug user. I read it and learned a few things about the law I didn\&#39;t know about. Definately a must read for anyone who uses any drugs whether it be a little or a lot. If you\&#39;re a dealer it gives you an outlook of legal information, but one of the author\&#39;s commandments in the book is &#34;Thou shall not sell&#34; which every dealer already knows. The only rule for dealers is DON\&#39;T GET CAUGHT.&#39;,
 &#39;Good book: Good story and interesting characters..A lot of history in this story that I found to be interesting..the life of Indians has always fascinated me.&#39;,
 &#34;Great History: I am a big fan of Ms. Blake&#39;s but this was not one of her better books. It dragged a lot at times but the history involved in the story more than made up for it. If you&#39;re a fan of people and their cultures, you might want to give this book a try.&#34;,
 &#39;Handy card holders: I play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards, which, since I have small hands and am also a klutz, I drop a lot and mix up. The card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone. They are also slightly curved to prevent other players from &#34;accidentally&#34; seeing your cards. A very good deal for klutzes everywhere.&#39;,
 &#34;It does the job: If you can&#39;t hold the cards, this will work but I believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box. The idea is to make it easier for the individual. It can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose. A block of wood will do better. The card holder shouldn&#39;t be a game within a game.&#34;,
 &#34;Buy this now!: Very attractive, solid and sturdy, materials are very well organized. Not the cheapest, but well worth it -- especially at the discount Amazon provides... And then there&#39;s the content -- top notch stuff, perfect.&#34;,
 &#39;Forward the Mage an Alternate Style: Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire, Swift and Sterne. This book set in &#34;Joe\&#39;s World&#34; is the second book in this series. Although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading. Once read I was hooked into asking &#34;where is the rest of this story&#34;, this is quite normal for this style of writing and I await eagerly the next volume.&#39;,
 &#34;Fantasy writing at its best: Eric Flint and Richard Roach&#39;s Forward The Mage is fantasy writing at its best: an artist-swordsman faces an evil sorcerer, arrest, and politics when his artistic ambitions are rerouted in a struggle for survival. Both feature fast-paced action and complex, believable settings.&#34;,
 &#34;A device grows old: Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap, but this book focuses on Gwendolyn, Benvenutti &amp; the Sorcerer. Story of events in these characters&#39; lives before, during, and after, Phil Strangler. Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time, and not as funny. If you loved Philosophical Strangler, you&#39;ll probably love this one, but if you were growing weary by the end of the Strangler, you should probably pass this one up.&#34;,
 &#34;Cool Documentary: I was extremely excited to pop this DVD into my computer and watch it. But please be aware this is more like a documentary. And please don&#39;t let me deter you from buying this DVD.A lot of interviews about the the World Championship mixed with some GREAT interludes of the interviewee riding. Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states, this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through, not about their riding skill and extreme stunts. I expected non-stop action, but this is still a great DVD to add to my collection. I&#39;ve watched it a few times just to watch them ride their riding chapters.A must buy for anyone serious about competitive DH racing. Shred it up all!&#34;,
 &#39;Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships: This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a &#34;Nimitz&#34;-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a &#34;great&#34; warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book.&#39;,
 &#34;Jabra Eargels: The service was good but the product didn&#39;t have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn&#39;t use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.&#34;,
 &#39;Jabra Ear Gels: These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!&#39;,
 &#39;What a waste: Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something, but good luck with that. In-ear earbuds work so much better than these.&#39;,
 &#39;Fast delivery, great product: Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.&#39;,
 &#34;JABRA EAR GELS: Save youself some money. The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste. They actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from Jawbone.I was even more disappointed that I paid $4.63 shipping on a worthless $9.99 product. It&#39;s not even worth returning. Lesson learned. Hopefully you will also.&#34;,
 &#39;jabra eargels: These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t waste your money: They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don&#39;t work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It&#39;s not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I&#39;d seen them in person I wouldn&#39;t have spent my money on them.&#34;,
 &#39;Not well suited for the Jawbone II: When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.&#39;,
 &#39;pain in the ear: They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically, a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped.&#39;,
 &#39;JEG: The product arrived as expected. The ear gels fit the JawBone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.&#39;,
 &#39;scottiesgems: I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t waste your money: After ordering these eargels, I spent an enormous amount of time trying to make them fit. It was useless. Unless you have elephant ears, or you wish to grease them and use a hammer to insert them, they won&#39;t work.&#34;,
 &#39;This movie is not all that: originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star, but because of one of the last scenes where ugly t(telemachus) threw two spears at once, i give it two stars. Everything was horrible to my opinion. The accents kept changing everything. If you read the book before you watched the movie, you would thinkt hat this was all a joke. So if anything just read the book by itself. So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T&#39;,
 &#34;Hmmmmmmm: I&#39;ve seen better movies on The All News Channel. Odysseus was played very well, but his part was boring. As well as the rest of the movie. Scylla looks like 1930&#39;s cartoons.I drew better stuff in 1st grade.Every single scene looks so fake it isn&#39;t even funny. I can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm. I would not recommend this to anyone young or old. This movie isn&#39;t worth a penny in my book!&#34;,
 &#34;Crap, all crap: ...you would have noticed how horrible the allusions are in this crap-that-calls-itself-a-movie. The characters were simply annoying; Telemakhos, the whiny school boy that cries whenever he doesn&#39;t get his way, creepy Athena, who&#39;s eyes are SUPPOSED to be gray, Penelope, who obviously has a more pleasureful time on the water on the beach than with her husband, and of course Odysseus, who would make me weep if he was my captain. The sets looked as if elementary school kids put them together, Scylla was a sock-puppet, and the shades were just sad. I have never in my life seen such crap and I hope you won&#39;t fall for these other 4-star reviews that make me want to PUKE!&#34;,
 &#39;The Odyssey with Armand Asanti: I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.&#39;,
 &#34;Great movie, but what&#39;s with the price?: I have seen this movie before, and was looking to buy it to show in my classroom, but...why the heck is it $99? It&#39;s good, but not THAT good!&#34;,
 &#39;Very BORING: This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see.&#39;,
 &#34;Birds, Beasts and Relatives: As always, Gerard Durrell&#39;s works make me want to hop on a flight to Greece right now. His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again. Slow paced and funny, this enjoyable book put Corfu at the top of my list of places to go.&#34;,
 &#39;I Don\&#39;t Think So!: Quite often, bringing a classic story like &#34;Moby Dick&#34; to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston\&#39;s 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn\&#39;t make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck\&#39;s rendition instead. You\&#39;ll be glad you did.&#39;,
 &#34;The white whale isn&#39;t: The annimation for the white whale was lousy. The original with G. Peck is a classic &amp; you can&#39;t do a remake to match it. The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk.&#34;,
 &#39;Did not fit in ear: I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear, in fact, after trying for a couple of weeks, I could not tell which one was the R and which was the L as they both fit so poorly. The spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing.I threw these out and purchased the Umbo earbud. Much, much better fit there.&#39;,
 &#39;Great Series opener: I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all.&#39;,
 &#39;The Face of a Stranger: Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory. This is a wonderful series and I would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book, &#34;The Face of a Stranger&#34; which is the first in the series, for a more complete appreciation of each following book.&#39;,
 &#39;Waste of time and money: I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder. I have sprayed all furniture, bedding, hard to reach spaces,etc. And a month later I still have fleas. It is a major waste of time and money.&#39;,
 &#34;This is not a normal Mercedes Lackey book.: When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was &#39;real&#39; enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows, without true substance (or reasons) to their actions. I couldn&#39;t find reasons to cheer for anyone. One problem is there were too many people to follow easily. Since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world.&#34;,
 &#34;I hope Frances Mayes Got A Lot of Money for the Rights...: I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can&#39;t understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms, foolishly thinking that the movie would get better, and after that I was done. Another good thing about DVDs is that you don&#39;t have to be kind and rewind. It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR. This movie is right up there with Ishtar! Except worse!&#34;,
 &#39;very much disappointed: It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View.&#39;,
 &#39;A very sexy and entertaining film! 5 stars!: A very sexy and entertaining film. Sure, this film is heartwarming and inspiring. It is also funny and pleasant. BUT it is also sexy, very sexy infact! And it is very enjoyable and entertaining. 5 stars!&#39;,
 &#39;Terrible movie: I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, &#34;we\&#39;ll make her a divorced woman...and then we\&#39;ll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let\&#39;s make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn\&#39;t known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man.&#34; All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character.&#39;,
 &#39;Last time I let the Blockbuster guy recommend a movie....: What a waste of two hours! As a romantic comedy, it falls short on both romance and comdey. As a movie trying to give over a lesson, it is trite, overdone, and poorly performed. The writing is unimpressive, the story is dull and far fetched, and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot. What was the point? They seemed to have forgotten to find one.&#39;,
 &#39;under the Tuscany Sun: Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new, just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie.&#39;,
 &#39;Wonderfully Inspiring Movie!: In this movie, as with life(usually),our &#34;plans&#34; from our &#34;beginnings&#34;, don\&#39;t work out like we think they will.[If yours have and you are one of the those living your dreams, twenty, fifty, etc. years later, I\&#39;m sure you are counting your blessings! ;)]Frances\&#39; &#34;new&#34; story begins when she acts on instinct instead of &#34;planning&#34; and thus life begins, rather unexpectedly to Frances, to have its own &#34;design&#34; for her life. She has her hopes and dreams for what her life will become. Little does she know she will get exactly what she asks for. However, as in true life, it may not be in the way you expect it.A truly, inspirational movie for anyone struggling through some tough times in your life. I can\&#39;t tell you how many times I\&#39;ve seen it, but I probably couldn\&#39;t use my fingers to count, even if I counted each of them twice!Also, must mention Diane Lane, Sandra Oh, you guys are the best!&#39;,
 &#39;Diane Lane is great but skip this movie: Diane Lane is the only redeemable part to this lame effort.The film takes tremendous liberties with the plot from the book. Way way too much PC madness.A waste of time and money.&#39;,
 &#39;Canon NB-5L good for the XS200IS: I think it\&#39;s always best to get the actual canon battery rather than a &#34;replacement substitute&#34;. The battery life so far is pretty good- at least 8 hours.&#39;,
 &#34;Here&#39;s what really happened...: The John Houseman character from the excellent James Caan original version, jumped into a time machine with the intent of destroying the social commentary critical to multinational monopolies from the first film and spreading cultural plastics so prevalent in his future history. The result is dumbed down junk where you must give up the idea of wondering how movie executive&#39;s decisions are made. I think he did a good job.&#34;,
 &#39;A failure of &#34;Battlefield Earth&#34; proportions!: I should say, &#34;worse than Battlefield Earth proportions!&#34; This whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go, &#34;why?&#34; Everything about this convoluted, sarcastic, beefed up, badly edited tripe is confusing to watch, poorly executed and loses you 10 minutes into the film. You are introduced to boring characters, cliched camera angles and material we all know John Mcteirnan is far more capable of. I was thankful I got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks! If you really want to see the real &#34;Rollerball&#34; rent (don\&#39;t buy) the original. The original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loud-James Caan! He\&#39;s a legend man!! I don\&#39;t know what kind of future Chris Klein has in movies but as far as action movies go, let\&#39;s just put it this way, we already have Keanu Reeves and quite bluntly, he\&#39;s a much better actor. Steer clear and save your money!&#39;,
 &#34;TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!: This movie was one of the worst films I&#39;ve seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I&#39;d give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star.&#34;,
 &#34;Horrible.: I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn&#39;t.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.&#34;,
 &#34;ZERO stars... OMG I can&#39;t believe I even bothered to finish this thing.: I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won&#39;t inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can&#39;t get any worse and then it did. &lt;repeat&gt; And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would.&#34;,
 &#34;Junk, need I say more JUNK: This movie should have never been made, there is basically no story present and is just a bunch of people going around on rollerblades bashing each other&#39;s brains in. I was really looking foreword to this flick, it&#39;s previews were misleading, it looked as though it was brilliant and exciting. Guess what, it&#39;s really really really NOT!Trust me don&#39;t waste your time unless the only thing better you have to do is give the cat a bath, even then I really don&#39;t believe you should waste your time!&#34;,
 &#39;I Hope I\&#39;m Not Allergic To It!: I ordered this, based on the reviews. I ordered on 11/16, and received it on 11/21 (I needed it by 11/29). I love the musky smell. I only tested 1 drop on my wrist. I have to say that after a couple of hours, the smell turned into a strong sex smell... not bad, but definitely sex. I\&#39;m going to test it out at work next week, but the real test is on 11/30. I\&#39;ll report my findings then.12/6/12: It works! This is definitely going to be my &#34;go-to&#34; scent. It drove my man crazy! I love it. I will purchase again.&#39;,
 &#39;concisely written: This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests. We are never going to be fluent in Russian but this little handbook makes communication possible. Thank you .&#39;,
 &#39;What the????: It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!&#39;,
 &#34;When Good Products Go Bad: I bought two of the 633&#39;s two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that, not the manufacturers). After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives. I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line (533/633) to buy a better one. Don&#39;t know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product.&#34;,
 &#39;Very disappointed: Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again.&#39;,
 &#39;Very large: These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However, for the price, I still think they are a great bargain. They are very heavy duty and will probably last many years. They are also very warm. Almost too warm here in southen California. Those people in cold climates would LOVE them! Anyhow, I would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit. But I just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine.&#39;,
 &#39;dont get it: Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man. U should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul PET.&#39;,
 &#34;Not a good toy: This toy isn&#39;t well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that&#39;s normal. If you like Megaman then I&#39;d get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.&#34;,
 &#39;JBL MRX512M: JBL has several price points for it\&#39;s professional sound reinforcement products. JRX is the least expensive and MRX is the second least expensive. The MRX series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price. These are normally $700.00 each. Amazon offered a new &#34;opened&#34; package which I was able to purchase for much less. These are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle. Power handling is between 400 and 1600 watts depending on the program. Nominal wattage is 800 watts into 8 ohms. Excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues. Speakon in and out connectors only. Non protruding handle. Great product.&#39;,
 &#34;Good for downhill only: I can&#39;t believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don&#39;t be fooled, this only good for down hill. While it is well built, you can&#39;t propel this trike as advertized. Save your money, don&#39;t buy this!&#34;,
 &#39;Pratchetts Best!!!!: Since I am a literature student I am a reads-everything-I-can-get person. Having once recognized Pratchetts works, I left all my classic German literature aside and started reading and reading and reading... . But this book, &#34;Small Gods&#34;, has beaten everything I\&#39;ve read before (even my all-time favorite &#34;Faust&#34; - you know: the Goethe one). It is witty, intelligent and above all deaply questioning. I remained nodding all the time:&#34;Yes, that\&#39;s what I always believed religion is about.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Pratchett Review Haiku: I&#39;ve been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here&#39;s an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky. Brutha must showthe heretics Truth.&#34;,
 &#34;Why do people like this garbage?: Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he&#39;s getting at with religion and what not, I&#39;ve just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don&#39;t know the things he&#39;s pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won&#39;t understand.&#34;,
 &#34;Boring plot.: I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn&#39;t like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic.&#34;,
 &#39;cross contamination: The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great &#34;silent damage&#34; to one\&#39;s intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet.&#39;,
 &#34;Just Accepting Gluten Free Life: I have read the other reviews of this book, and while I appreciate everyone&#39;s opinions I must say that this book helped me immensely! I am new to the gluten free life. I have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues. I had NO prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears. I haven&#39;t read Against the Grain, so I cannot compare the two. Jax made me laugh often, even through my tears. I recommend it for those just starting out.&#34;,
 &#34;Terrible!: My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck&#39;s book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck&#39;s book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease.&#34;,
 &#39;get the facts: Most of the people who gave shining, sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel. It is not boring. Jax is a talented writer, I\&#39;ll give her that. But when I read on page 394 that the perscription drugs I was on and had been on for 5 years (both Pfizer drugs) were not GF I was seriously troubled.Many follow-ups with both Pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book is.I went off my meds immediately thinking I was injesting gluten. I suffered the undue consequences of going off &#34;cold turkey&#34; when I needed to taper off. In actuality those meds ARE GF, and always were!!!If you want the facts (as boring as they are) -- dont rely on this book. If you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read, but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt, as they say.Jax was indeed very lax when writing this book.&#39;,
 &#39;Thank God for Jax Peters Lowell ! !: What a wonderful, easy book to read. And so helpful. So many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read. Not the Gluten-Free Bible. It is clear, easy-to-understand and very engaging. I really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten-free to everyday life. It is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very, very informative at the same time. I have never written a book review before, but I am so impressed with The Gluten-Free Bible that I want to share these thoughts with everyone and I intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful, witty writer. Enjoy! To your health!&#39;,
 &#39;Not useful and a waste of money: The software does not cocur to the current USMLE pattern.It is a waste of money. The questions present on the trial CD are misleading....they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!&#39;,
 &#39;Devoid of depth or even much substance: The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a &#34;forest&#34; level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. &#34;Raising Your Spirited Child&#34; is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization\&#39;s recommendation) that the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight.&#39;,
 &#34;Try something else.: I picked up this book at B&amp;N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn&#39;t we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters.&#34;,
 &#39;Mr. Dickens slams industrial horror scenes.: Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown. He writes with a sharp knife about poverty, hunger, cruel management and lack of compassion. Humor here is on the grim side.&#39;,
 &#34;Less than one star.: Didn&#39;t like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!! Unbelievable! 2. the heroine was way too dependent upon daddy; did she not have any type of backbone? 3. The biggest, Ben knew the truth and yet he had to create all this angst on both their parts!!! YUCK!!&#34;,
 &#34;Parents - Don&#39;t waste your money! Buy the GBA game: I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don&#39;t work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other.&#34;,
 &#39;Rivetting Sci-Fi in Paradise: A regular nail biter: strong plotlines, excellent cast give relaible performances, killer locations. Sci-fi what-if horror flick with a twist. Who knew Tim Hutton was a sci-fi fan? Nice uncomplicated performance.,&#39;,
 &#39;A Must Have: For those familiar with the Burzum name, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is largely and widely accepted as his crowning achievement. Utilizing a stunning mixture of layered guitar melodies, gloomy synths, and thunderous percussion, Varg works his way through three hypnotic metal songs before the ambitious ambient outro - Tomhet. Rather than sit here and rattle on about the magic contained within this record, I would rather just claim that it is a must have for any black metal fan, and ranks among the highest calibur or metal releases period.&#39;,
 &#34;Super Reader: An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky &#39;now who was that&#39; style cameos, a la John Myers Myers&#39; Silverlock.Dracula has found another way to be in charge in England, by marrying in to the royal family. To prevent problems, he has had the Great Detective thrown in a prison camp.So when a serial killed called Silver Knife is killing vampire whores, it falls to the Diogenes Club to investigate. Vampires heal normal wounds, but not silver. The investigation uncovers a lot more than just a chain of killings.&#34;,
 &#34;Politics?: A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House&#39;s argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, &#39;The Viewer of Modern Life&#39; is well worth a read.&#34;,
 &#39;A Must for Handgunners - Old and New: This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive. But it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts. See alsoThe Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About Guns, Crime, and the Second Amendment.&#39;,
 &#39;Lousy Camera: This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn\&#39;t that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally &#34;twisted&#34;.I can\&#39;t belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don\&#39;t buy one.&#39;,
 &#34;Piece of junk: Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you&#39;ll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.&#34;,
 &#39;Video too!: I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .&#39;,
 &#39;Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!: This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the &#34;best&#34; of Motown, in which the Holland/Dozier/Holland tagline under the title of the record meant high quality R&amp;B;, and almost always resulted in a mega-hit. The collection begins with the very earliest hit -- Eddie Holland singing &#34;Jamie&#34;, and proceeds through most of the major early hits of The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Mary Wells, The Marvalettes, The 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, and more.This CD replaces my old collection of 45 RPM recordings, and has allowed me to enjoy the Motown Sound without haaving a huge number of CD\&#39;s to collect. The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: &#34;My World is Empty Without You&#34; and &#34;Forever Came Today&#34;. In all, the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories: The soundtrack to my teenage years; Rock On!!&#39;,
 &#34;Great true crime read: I really have to give this author credit, as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin&#39;s killers, and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother. The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read.&#34;,
 &#39;static central: Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices, speakers and headphones, and all have the same result, static. Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $3 shipped to begin with.&#39;,
 &#34;I expected something better: EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that&#39;s what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I&#39;ve long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn&#39;t get what they expected based on the product description, I think it&#39;s safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I&#39;d buy from another shipper.&#34;,
 &#39;Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail: Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I\&#39;ve tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first &#34;click&#34; (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones.&#39;,
 &#34;Freud is crazy!: I&#39;ve studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud&#39;s work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so.&#34;,
 &#34;If life is a dream, then don&#39;t wake me up: This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud&#39;s eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work.&#34;,
 &#34;It arriived: Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I&#39;ll update whenever I read it. d&#34;,
 &#39;Barely Unbeatable Theory: Freud\&#39;s &#34;The Interpretation of Dreams&#34; is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud\&#39;s theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud\&#39;s dream theory.&#39;,
 &#34;When did Grandpa die and what do we tell the kids?: Grandma and a brother? That&#39;s just weird. I&#39;m a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I, I!, bought my Granddaughter the dollhouse and the full set of house furniture. What the, no, wtf were they thinking? Simpletons rule the fricking world. Grandma? Grandpa. Brother? Sister. Idiots.That said my Granddaughter loves this entire set. Full on wonderful for her, and yes if they came out with Grandpa with a sister I would buy both sets, throw the older brother away and give her the rest so maybe their not idiots, just soulless vampires.&#34;,
 &#34;Amazon.com sent wrong size: Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn&#39;t work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.&#34;,
 &#39;One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.: This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here. What is here is his last composition, the “Hesperus-Bahnen Waltz”, published as Op 279, after the forty-three year old composer’s death.&#39;,
 &#39;Janet, is the Best female singer!: I watched The Velvet rope tour on HBO and it was the bomb, it was the greatest tour that I have ever seen, everything was choreographed pefectly, the music was slammin and Janet really communicated with her fans. When she sang &#34;I get Lonely&#34;, &#34;Nasty&#34; and &#34;You&#34;, it sent me Crazy. I love you Janet!&#39;,
 &#39;Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!: If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a &#34;must have&#34; for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!&#39;,
 &#39;Captivating: Very simply, I was unable to put this book down. Not unlike some of the other reviewers I too was on my way to Boston on business whilst reading this &#34;glued to my seat&#34; book. For the first time, I can say that I was pleased for all the flight delays as I managed to finish reading this book on route. I am an avid reader and can say without reservation that Rapid Descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors, such as Crichton, Grisham, Cook etc to name a few of my favorites. Well Done Dr. Jack when\&#39;s the next one.....&#39;,
 &#39;Sure she\&#39;s a little annoying... BUT.: Yes, by reading every review we all know by now that Sheri is a wee bit annoying, and her &#34;participants&#34; are an interesting sort of people, AND YES it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it. BUT everything in this DVD is so valuable! I learned everything I needed to know through this DVD without taking more time off work to go to classes. And since it was always available to me by the touch of a button I was able to review the important things while I was acually in labor. I had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be 5 mins apart before we went to the hospital, so I popped in the DVD, and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance, he was taking notes! This was my first child and thanks to Sheri my labor was only 12 hour and I only pushed for 20 mins, 3 good ones and he was out! I think doing what Sheri says and waiting till your dialated 5 cm before you get an epideral was really key.&#39;,
 &#34;Great Information: My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We&#39;ve been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.&#34;,
 &#39;Good Overview and Very Informative: I really enjoyed this DVD, it provided good content at a nice pace. I highly recommend this DVD.&#39;,
 &#34;Superb!: When I was 5 months pregnant, I&#39;m desperate to take Child Birth Class in order to help me have Normal Delivery. I searched over the net the best detailed class. Voila! I came accross this product on one of my searches. I never had second thoughts of ordering this product. I regularly viewed and applied all the techniques taught on DVD. It really works! I had an easy labor plus I had Normal Delivery. Superb! I recommend this DVD for those who wanted a Modern and comprehensive Child Birth Class. - Margery Bermejo (Davao City, Philippines)&#34;,
 &#34;Chilbirth Education Video: Great videos!!!! I&#39;m a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch! They helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience. They also helped review and update me on current L and D practices. Thanks for a wonderful product!&#34;,
 &#34;TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH: I&#39;m sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she&#39;s a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest.&#34;,
 &#34;GO FOR IT!: This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I&#39;m a woman, why not?) The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it&#39;s growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it&#39;s like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn&#39;t be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!&#34;,
 &#34;LOVED this video!: After I bought this DVD, I watched it about 8 times on my own and with my husband before our son was born. We both laughed at Sheri&#39;s mannerisms but really loved all we learned from her. We both felt more prepared, even though we weren&#39;t able to attend birthing classes.&#34;,
 &#34;RECOMMEND!: I was going for a med-free birth...not for any reason other than I wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and I and I figured I could do it as well. It&#39;s what our bodies are meant to do, right? Well, this DVD was great! It saved me from paying over $100 for a lamaze class and I felt the stuff she touched on for the lamaze section was perfect. I did not have a doula or a midwife...just my husband, an awesome nurse and this DVD. I enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch. It&#39;s a bit OUTDATED, and CHEESY, but overall very honest and good. Worked for me. If anything, its worht the few $$ for reference AFTER a birthing class. (I&#39;m giving 4 stars instead of 5, b/c they should really look into updating it soon).&#34;,
 &#34;Couldn&#39;t finish watching: Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn&#39;t waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes, but wanted a refresher before the big event. While the information is consistent with what we&#39;ve learned from other professionals - the presenter is terribly annoying. Although we wanted the information, the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching. If you can deal with the presenter&#39;s sense of humor, you&#39;ll benefit from the information - good luck!&#34;,
 &#39;very informative: Laugh and Learn About Childbirthexcellent information, and humorous all at the same time !!!&#39;,
 &#34;Poignant &amp; Intelligent -- give this one a listen!: Ron&#39;s playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no-holds-barred clairvoyance I came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me. I find him to be a certifiable, bonafide talent -- one of life&#39;s genuine little treasures secreted away in the mountains of Montana. In a way I am [selfishly] sorry to hear his album is realizing such widespread success -- I was kind of hoping to keep him all to myself.&#34;,
 &#39;Exquisitely fresh, jazzy &amp; melodius, crisp &amp; classy!: Mysterious jazz that rolls into the imaginary worlds of a Native American dance, a smokey Nashville nightclub, a cruise with the whales...hints of Paul Consort with a crisp and haunting classical foundation, a journey through the 20th Century...and back again into the lonely Montana night where Ron strolls with star gazing abandon.&#39;,
 &#34;At least it&#39;s free: I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it&#39;s free, though...&#34;,
 &#39;Yardbirds: Very informative and fun to listen to for someone of my generation. I had heard bits and pieces of the Yardbirds story, but never the complete picture.&#39;,
 &#39;One of my favorites...: ...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90\&#39;s. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in &#34;Revenge&#34;. So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, &#34;got-nothing-else-to-do&#34; movies.It\&#39;s definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right. Give it a shot. I don\&#39;t think you\&#39;ll be disappointed.&#39;,
 &#34;Nice French farce, similar to &#39;un elephant&#39;: Showed this film to my French class, and it was a hit. The same actors as in Jean de Florette, but about 20 years later. Thoroughly enjoyable.&#34;,
 &#34;Daniel Auteuil is fabulous: I&#39;ve been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.&#34;,
 &#34;This book is AWEFUL: I read this book 3-4 years ago. It&#39;s still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn&#39;t really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended.&#34;,
 &#34;Captivating and Engrossing: When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong, self-assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing. I have given this book to my sisters and to several friends. And whenever I get into a discussion about &#39;good books&#39; this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa. He wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english. And this was the first book I thouht to send him. Well that and a dictionary.Thanks to Jean Auel for writing such a great novel.&#34;,
 &#39;Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!!: I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought &#34;another one of your lousy stories&#34; I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence.......&#39;,
 &#34;one of the best series EVER!!!: When my dad first gave me this book to read, it had the orignal cover, and was sort of deteriorating, and I had a feeling that I woudln&#39;t really like it. That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it&#39;s hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I&#39;d recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!&#34;,
 &#34;Giants Mats: The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that&#39;s like having a pair of bootleg mats.&#34;,
 &#39;Exactly what I ordered: Product arrived on time, in great condition. As usual, Amazon provided a vehicle to acquire a product that I wanted.&#39;,
 &#34;Touching: Beautiful film, excellent acting. The story transports you to other worlds to experience the full gamut of emotions. These are real people with real issues, another example of life being stranger than fiction, as portrayed in a film. Hope there&#39;s a Part II. :)&#34;,
 &#39;One of the best foreign language films: For once, a film coming from a north european country that is neither unhealthy nor perverse.Suzanne Bier is a wonderful director as she proved in two of my favorite films &#34;Things we lost in the fire&#34; and &#34;Brothers&#34;.&#39;,
 &#39;Wonderfully emotional.: Great story line. The pacing of the plot was well thought out (sometimes rather predictable) but the actors really brought a sense of honesty.&#39;,
 &#34;The remix is different: I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster, so decided what the heck. I chose poorly - the remixes just don&#39;t sound right. For all I know, this 2006 version was the original intent, I hope not.&#34;,
 &#39;Why the remix?: If a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like Pearl Jam did with their recent re-release of 10, not replace the original album mix like Mushroom is doing here. This new remix is not as good as the original versions of these songs. Wish they would remaster the original mix and issue it.&#39;,
 &#39;Art and Passion...but no Science: A series of short vignettes about fencing, none detailed enough to impart and real knowledge. A definite lack of technical instruction on fencing. Not sure who this video would be useful for...certainly not a beginner trying to learn about the technical aspects of the sport.&#39;,
 &#34;No illustrations: The Kindle version has no illustrations, and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses. The limericks appear without logical line shifts, and where the illustration is supposed to be, it just says [illustration] which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all.It&#39;s free, but it&#39;s hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it, at least for me.&#34;,
 &#34;No drawings!: I love love loved Edward Lear but unfortunately this free copy doesn&#39;t have the marvelous drawings. It would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book, one that is illustrated.&#34;,
 &#34;what hard rock is all about: Cut the crap! it&#39;s motorhead, it&#39;s rock n&#39; roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i&#39;ll be your sister, metropolis.&#34;,
 &#39;Thuvia maid of mars: Typical ERB Mars series, which I find light reading. Not too much depth or thought provoking, but nice escape from everyday.&#39;,
 &#34;Old-School Bore Metal: This album offers nothing new or exciting to the genre of metal. This is reminiscent of mediocre late 80&#39;s trash metal, with all songs sounding the same. Mid-paced tempos and simplistic solos abound, with moronic wayyyyy-out-of-date pretend-satanic lyrics and cartoony cover art. Just dumb, dumb, dumb. Want real thrash metal, aside from the Big Four? Try Coroner, Arch Enemy, Arsis, The Crown, the Haunted, Hypocrisy, and a ton of others that poop all over this album from miles above.&#34;,
 &#34;Only works with Microsoft e-mail clients: If you are security minded and choose to use an e-mail client like Thunderbird or the bundled Opera e-mail client this program will NOT protect you! Not only that, but the fact that CA Anti-virus will ONLY work with MS Outlook or Outlook Express is not revealed in any documentation. I found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my Opera mail folder and couldn&#39;t clean or quarantine it! The CA tech confirmed that the AV program only works with MS e-mail clients. To me this is false advertising!!!&#34;,
 &#34;A new beginning...: This was their first true recording project, although it was thier second full album. I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it&#39;s an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come. Purchas and enjoy!&#34;,
 &#34;Do not order from Ritz Camera - wrong item: Do not order this item and expect to get what you see. I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A). Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon&#39;s blessing. Buyer beware. This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon&#39;s partners, and Amazon will do nothing to help you.&#34;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s an ad.: This book is nothing more than a 160 page ad for Stauber\&#39;s school/store in CakeEater, MN. There is no &#34;How To&#34; advise in this book.&#39;,
 &#39;A Jesse Stuart Harvest: My opinion of it: A Jesse Stuart Harvest is a collection of stories by Jesse Stuart. All the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the Old West. This book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author, Jesse Stuart.I think this book is really good because it takes you on a trip through time and into a world of adventure. My favorite story was Snake Teeth because it has a lot of cliffhangers and adventure. I would recommend this book for 9 yrs.-adults because normally after 9 years of age you will understand the dialect in this book.&#39;,
 &#39;Flyboys: Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film.&#39;,
 &#39;World War I aviation visited: I have enjoyed watching &#34;Flyboys&#34; several times. The special effects are outstanding and very lifelike. One of the features that I really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end. I noticed that one of the people interviewed was from Colorado and as a result I went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the movie.I find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it.&#39;,
 &#34;fly boys: i haven&#39;t watched this movie. it was purchased for a christmas present. i heard about this movie on american family radio and they gave it wonderfuly reviews. my brother is ex-military and loves these types of movie. since afr gave them a wonderful review, i thought this would be something that he would enjoy.&#34;,
 &#34;Sappy and Stupid: This is a very bad movie. Bad music, bad acting, bad special effects. A slow and predictable plot line. Glad we borrowed it and didn&#39;t buy this one!&#34;,
 &#39;This CD Rulez: I think that this is one of the best CD\&#39;s ever. I really like the song &#34;Gravity&#34; and &#34;Next Time&#34;. Those are the best songs on the CD. Everone should get this CD. It is a must.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Souless Pop?&#34; Not here: When I was sick a few weeks ago my brother bought me this cd. Just one spin and I was hooked. What a pleasent surprise! I was expecting heartless trash with the &#34;lou pearlman&#34; sound to it. (remember o-town??&#34; This cd is definatly nothing like that. The main singer (Guthrie) wrote most of the songs himself. Along with the fact the group does not do choreographed dancing. (Is it me or is anybody else sick of that??) The ratings are out of a scale of 1-4Ohh its kinda crazy- 3 1/2No one does it better- 4 (great harmonies)I don\&#39;t need anyone- 3Feelin\&#39; You- 3 1/2Faded- 4 (everyones fav; wassup sarah?)Lets do it right- 3Only in my mind- 3.5Stay- 4Baby come back- 3Gravity- 2.5Next Time- 4*In memory of Michael Cuccione of 2gether 1985-2001*&#39;,
 &#34;Thank God: I thank God for the writer of this book. This book explains new insight on Jesus&#39; parables, taking in consideration of the Lord&#39;s geographical location and culture.It took me a while to read this book. Why? Because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it. Its not something that you read and let bygones be bygons.This book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as Jesus&#39; followers. It addresses issues like greed or Me-society that we often ignore. I&#39;d like to stress out that Jesus pointed everything plainly for us. This book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if God is really what motivates us in everything we do.I love this book and will give it to friends I know. Please pray for me so I can share it to others as well, and also put the Jesus&#39; words into action.Thank God.&#34;,
 &#34;getting tired of the cliche: Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy, you are taking Anatomy 101, and believe me, this movie doesn&#39;t help you pass that class!). Many scenes are too dark to tell what happened. Hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen, and the next thing you know, someone has dropped. It is okay to see it for free, but not worth it when you pay for the ticket.&#34;,
 &#34;shameful ripoff: even in the hour plus &#39;&#39;build-up/charactor developement&#39;&#39;.i guess talky,anti american &#39;&#39;horror&#39;&#39; movies is the latest trend.i was watching the talky trailer on my computer and got sleepy.&#34;,
 &#34;Great movie, horrible DVD!: Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film.&#34;,
 &#34;How STUPED can you GET!: I&#39;ll tell you how stuped you can get, this movie is how stuped you can get. This is one of the STUPEDEST movie I have ever seen and trust me I&#39;ve seen alot of movies.The whole movie is dumb exspecailly the actors.I recamend you not see this movie actshoally I more than recamend you I BEG you not to see this movie But if you incest to I recamend you borrow it from a friend your if you can&#39;t, rent it at the cheapest place you no before wasting your money on buying it. But if I were you I won&#39;t wast my money at all.&#34;,
 &#39;Mighty Ducks rulz: This is a fun movie for children. My sons watched this too many times when they were 4-6 years old and I am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey. I know that sounds corny but it is true. My oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school &amp; club. Good clean movie. I bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game. Hopefully it will impact them like it did ours. GO DUCKS!&#39;,
 &#39;What\&#39;s this?...: When i first heard his single &#34;One Wish&#34; i thought this is a good tune, but then he got to the second verse, i thought eh? This guy cant sing! later on his album came along, his vocals destroy his tracks, literally. Comparing him to other artists such as Mario or 112, you\&#39;ll realize that he can\&#39;t sing, full stop. Disappointing.&#39;,
 &#34;raydiation: Thank God he stopped rapping, but now this album sucks too! Glad it was free. He&#39;s reppin&#39; Cali too- oh hell no! The crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like R. Kelly and Timberland and they did him wrong! There are only three tight songs numbers 3, 4 and 5, all were produced by Rodney Jerkins, he can&#39;t be his sister though, this album proves Ray J just ain&#39;t got it, maybe he could if he had just stuck with using Rodney Jerkins. But the beats are not supposed to make you tight, your supposed to make that beat what it is and more.&#34;,
 &#34;WELL DONE RAY J.: This is a good come-back from the &#39;This Aint A Game&#39; album, that album was good wit songs like &#39;wait a minute&#39;, &#39;where do we go from here&#39;, &#39;wet me&#39; and &#39;formal invite&#39;,etc. However, this album is even better. You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy&#39;s kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: &#39;Exotic&#39; - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. &#39;In tha Mood&#39;, &#39;Anytime&#39;, &#39;One Wish&#39;, &#39;What I Need&#39; and the crunk track &#39;Keep Sweatin&#39;. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like &#39;Quit Actin&#39; - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. &#39;The War Is Over&#39; - i liked the last duet they did &#39;another day in paradise&#39; bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ... WELL DONE RAY J.&#34;,
 &#39;Stew: Well I am.... I have to say in all honesty.... A true Magnum fan, In the past I followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best, which was in my own personal opinion...All the time ! Vigilante is certainly one of Magnum`s finest example`s of good solid heavy rock on any one given Cd ! &#34;Need a lot of Love&#34; is one of there finest along with &#34;Vigilante&#34; of coarse ! And there is also track`s like &#34;Lonely Night&#34; and &#34;Midnight&#34; on there too ! I personally have all Magnum`s Cd`s as I`m so into there genre of music and culture ! I Simply could`nt be without ! But if you like a bit of Live in concert Magnum then i recomend that You get you`re hand`s on Magnum`s &#34;Live&#34; cd !&#39;,
 &#34;don&#39;t waste your money: I love historical novels, and that&#39;s what I thought this book was, with the added bonus of naughtiness. What I got was a book with stories (I read 3 of them before I gave up)that had to be written by horney 13 year olds. This single purchase has me rethinking my loyalty to Amazon.&#34;,
 &#34;Brilliant reinvention: Bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel. It&#39;s not a sequel to A Christmas Carol, as some readers assume. It&#39;s a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material, slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your Dickens, but in no way detract if you&#39;re just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thriller.Remarkable. Definitely a writer to watch.&#34;,
 &#39;Contrived -- SPOILER ALERT: This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim\&#39;s parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The &#34;mystery&#34; though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn\&#39;t have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim\&#39;s true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying.&#39;,
 &#34;Too bad it&#39;s boring: The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard&#39;s Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn&#39;t care less about Tim. The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat.&#34;,
 &#39;carnivale: Wow the whole show was entertaining. It felt like you were in heaven just dancing to the beats along with Ricky, the dancers and the band. The whole concert was great and really entertaining, it felt so much like Carnivale.&#39;,
 &#34;Once again, a great book chopped up like onions.: At a wimpy 85 minutes, so much is left out that unless you&#39;ve read the book, a lot of what is happening probably won&#39;t make any sense.Avoid the movie, but definitely read the book by my favorite author Douglas Kennedy&#34;,
 &#34;Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb: After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb, I eagerly awaited the latest book from Lene (I also lived in and speak Danish -- an added bonus). However, I found Lene&#39;s chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such. For gaining insight into the state of mind for Lene, it was interesting. For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy, stick to the other 2 books.&#34;,
 &#39;Don\&#39;t bother!: This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn\&#39;t wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with &#34;Into Thin Air&#34; or &#34;The Climb&#34;. Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is.&#39;,
 &#39;This is not a book about climbing Mt. Everest...: ...it\&#39;s about being &#34;proud of being the first Danish woman to do so&#34; - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady, definitely NOT recommended&#39;,
 &#34;Best Show Around: Even if you don&#39;t like this programme (how could you not???), it&#39;s worth buying simply to watch George Eads the whole way through. He&#39;s so hot. The combination of a good cast and interesting (if not often creepy) storylines, keeps me watching this show each and every week and I could watch all of these episodes over and over. Go out and buy this now. It will get you hooked.&#34;,
 &#39;cj: It has a robust taste and a good topping to macaroni. Good addition for a quick nutritional meal. It does resemble a cheddar cheese flavor without the salty taste.&#39;,
 &#34;This is a great game for rookies, champs, and bored kids!: This game is fun, exciting, and easy to learn how to play. I got this for Christmas last year, and I still love to play. Trust me, I have a very short attention span and a complex mind and found this game great.Pros:*cool monsters to raise*tournaments to win*many secret breeds to unlock*many tasks to accomplish*lots of monsters to pick from*challenging for pro gamers*enjoyable for untalented gamers*rules aren&#39;t confusing*good graphicsCons:*people talk a lot*monsters only have 4-5 year life spansThis game is varied so that a variety of people can enjoy. At first it is Ahhh,uhhh, okay. Then once you understand, it becomes great fun.I had this game in fifth grade and my friend and I shared so much laughter and good memories. This is a good game for anyone, so try it.&#34;,
 &#34;From the biggest CULT of all!: So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That&#39;s what the New Age is really all about. It&#39;s that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn&#39;t Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?&#34;,
 &#39;Pro?! Huh?: Not detail in explaining conceptsToo few numerical examplesContent far too simple to be a desktop ref. in the dealing rm.Poor editing and formatting90% similar to the earlier edition.&#39;,
 &#39;Good, but not great: When I first heard this album I loved it. After listening to it more closely, I still like it a lot, but am not quite so blown away by it. When it first came out, it might have been groundbreaking, but so much has happened since in the world of technical/avant-garde metal, that much of this album now sounds a little tame. The material hasn\&#39;t aged very well. There are a couple of truly great songs in the middle-- all of the others are definitely good, just not mind-blowing (as some of the material on their older albums still is). The new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band-- a great improvement over Snake, in my opinion. If you want a truly great album, though, get their next, &#34;Phobos.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;I gave it a try...: Sorry... I gave this album a few spins but I still can&#39;t think of a one good thing to say about it. Except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing you&#39;ll ever hear... can&#39;t say it&#39;s not original, but in this case that&#39;s not necessairly a good thing. If you&#39;re not familiar with this band, this probably wouldn&#39;t be the best album to start with.&#34;,
 &#34;Does not work on Windows XP!: Beware. This game does not work with Windows XP. The vendor said that it would work on any XP Version except Media-Center, but I have XP Pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution. I suspect that it&#39;s like another game we purchased that worked fine when XP first came out, but Windows Auto Update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old Win 98 games like this.We have it up and running on an 11 year old laptop with Win 98 , but it&#39;s too CPU intensive to run properly on that old thing.The game seems OK for the right PC and operating system though...&#34;,
 &#39;if you love cats,get this!!: I have had this book for awhile,now,and the only thiong I dont care for are the colored charts...I just cant do them,as a LOT of people cant,especially the older we get. I have a ginger tabby named Sassy who looks just like the cat on the cover...she is draped over a sofa....having that piece will forever remind me of her after she is no longer here to drape over the couch.....You wont be disappointed if you can get by the colored charts. In fact I gave it 4 stars because of the colored charts....&#39;,
 &#34;terrible: Unable to use on my television. Advertisement didn&#39;t advise me that it needed a special television to play this game.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Hope&#34; may be a wrong concept.: I wonder, does a person have be seriously ill to write such a powerful book like Orwell did... He had no hope and he imagined all world in his situation. That\&#39;s very interesting&#39;,
 &#39;A timeless classic that\&#39;s an unforgettable must-read.: This is the timeless classic which the term &#34;Orwellian&#34; and&#34;Big Brother&#34; are derived. This terrifying look into apossible future in which the Government &#34;Big Brother&#34; holdstotal control over the populace. Orwell\&#39;s vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a must-readfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental control.-Hans Chen&#39;,
 &#39;1984: Orwell\&#39;s futuristic 1984 was a pleasure to read. The detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest Winston and Julia. The paper weight symbolizes the end of Winston and Julia\&#39;s private and secure existence, which allow them to be safe with each other. They found refuge in the small apartment where they could be themselves without &#34;Big Brother&#34; watching their every move, it\&#39;s ironic the government was still able to scrutinize every moment of their lives. I enjoyed reading this novel. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Orwell.&#39;,
 &#34;1984: 1984 over all is a very boring book. Their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again. I don&#39;t really like futuristic based books and the book 1984 is a perfect example why. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this book to any one, unless your into this type of genre. I give this book 1*.&#34;,
 &#34;Not a helpful history book AT ALL: I was doing a research paper on the year 1984, and according to my teacher, NONE of this actually happened.I got a flippin&#39; F.Last time I ever read a history book by this Orwell scrub.He doesn&#39;t know a thing about the 80s.Not ONCE did he mention Def Leppard or Karma Chameleon.I gave my copy to a donkey.He said it was about communism.Ass.&#34;,
 &#34;TEACHERS??: I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son, because no one can be considered well read without this in one&#39;s history.&#34;,
 &#39;If you haven\&#39;t read it, you owe it to yourself: I just read this for the first time at 28. Wow, what an eye opener. The things Orwell predicted in 1984, such as the technology, is amazing considering how long ago it was written. The politics are messed up by current standards, but frighteningly possible. The tense mood of the book draws you in, and there are moments (especially near the end) that would be truly terrifying to experience. The chapter with &#34;Room 101&#34; I read with a shudder.The reason I didn\&#39;t give it 5 stars is because it bogs down a few times. I understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be, but a slow start to any book is rather annoying.&#39;,
 &#34;Scary!: George Orwell&#39;s prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes; You&#39;d see it too, if you got off the TV and started paying attention to politicians and the laws they&#39;re passing.I hope there is a revolution of some sort before this grim forecast is played out to the end.&#34;,
 &#39;disturbing and relevant: I\&#39;m surprised that Noam Chomsky hasn\&#39;t been mentioned in any of the 299 previous reviews. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant, because the phenomena identified by Orwell (doublethink, newspeak, etc.) are, in various forms, actively used today in even the freest societies. Chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this. &#34;I\&#39;ve repeatedly found,&#34; he says, &#34;that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated, I can skip lots of the background ... because it\&#39;s already obvious and taken for granted by everyone.&#34; Curious?&#39;,
 &#39;The greatest work of the 20th Century: What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read, which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in.&#39;,
 &#34;Orwel Rolls in His Grave: This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950&#39;s I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda, how the government watches the people, listens to the people.. this book is good if you care about the world. this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it. this book is good if you are someone who doesn&#39;t want to be controlled or fooled.kindof like the way we are today sadly..&#34;,
 &#34;A Thoughtful Read: Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy&#39;s manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else.&#34;,
 &#39;The title should be revised to say 2004!: With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI, CIA, INS, and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases. They are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system, better not have anything to hide.September 11th accelerated the path that we were already on. I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment. I just hope that these &#34;mistakes, misquotes, and misinformed&#34; changes never occur in such a draconian fashion.Great book. Everyone should have a copy on their shelves.&#39;,
 &#39;George had a good idea but the book really stunk.: At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don\&#39;t read that &#34;Brave New World&#34; book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON\&#39;T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time.&#39;,
 &#34;two plus two makes FOUR!!!!: George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought, emotion and action would be monitored by the government.1984 tells the story of Winston living in a socialist country, feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel.Orwell is able to convey the helplessness of Winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences. However, as the plot thickens Orwell extends the sentences conveying Winton&#39;s hope and rebellion.1984 is truly captivating and rather depressing. As I read I saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but I couldn&#39;t put this book down.&#34;,
 &#39;A Very Interesting Read: At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read, It was assigned to me as an English project I.S.U (Independent Study Unit) so like every kid in high school I started to dread it. As I started to read though, the story started to get better and better. There were points where I just wanted to continue reading and not put it down. The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like. Although at the beginning it does start out very slow, it is a very good read.If you read this book and enjoyed it, also take a look at &#34;Brave New World&#34; by Aldous Huxley. It is quite similar to &#34;1984&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Let\&#39;s not pat ourselves on the back that this didn\&#39;t happen.: I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back, it is a truly great book. Like many of the enduring works of Science Fiction, its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into. Big Brother, The Two-Minutes Hate, Room 101 are all here. What\&#39;s scary is how some of this seems to be coming true - but Big Brother isn\&#39;t so much the government as it is Corporations. Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us &#34;We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!&#34; they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. &#34;We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears.&#34; Orwell would\&#39;ve been so proud.&#39;,
 &#34;Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...: OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn&#39;t hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author&#39;s other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn&#39;t mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend &#39;Dune&#39;, by Frank Herbert, &#39;2001: A Space Odyssey&#39;, by Arthur C. Clarke, or &#39;Enders Game&#39;, by Orson Scott Card.&#34;,
 &#39;1984: I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up, I fell asleep. I had to read it for school, and it took forever to get here when I ordered it. Barely finished it in time.&#39;,
 &#34;masterpiece: I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother. Thought crimes. Room 101. It fits perfectly. Of course, whether that was Orwell&#39;s intent I don&#39;t know (though he was an atheist), but I think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope&#34;,
 &#39;1984 as true today as in 1948: For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future, and could never happen, I would just ask you to look at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union from a historical perspective. But, then again, there are 2 billion people in China who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have. Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo). Children please read the newspaper once and a while.&#39;,
 &#39;I thought the book was great.: I thought the book was good to read. It gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to. I enjoyed reading it. I kept me in suspence.&#39;,
 &#34;When Already?: Like others here, I&#39;m wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable, laugh-out-loud sit-coms of all timewill ever be released. I bought Season 1 for a song when Borders went out of business,expecting a series I loved at the time to have dated badly. It hadn&#39;t.A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audienceI quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I&#39;ve pre-ordereda box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released. When already? Ever?&#34;,
 &#34;Might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries.: I always rely on Amazon customer reviews - this is the first time I have been so completely disappointed. I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air, and that was with the fan on High. Due to the size and shape of the fan blades, no air comes out of the center of the fan; what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan. I won&#39;t comment on the light, since I wasn&#39;t interested it that option. Just got it, and I am sending it right back.&#34;,
 &#39;:\\: If I could give this a negative rating I would. I guess I was unlucky. Installed batteries, light would NOT shut off. I figured I would just &#34;break&#34; the lights since I only needed the fan. Well before I could do that, the fan went out.&#39;,
 &#34;Like silky, velvet dreams: The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I&#39;d be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I&#39;d have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea.&#34;,
 &#34;He isn&#39;t what I remember.: The CD isn&#39;t what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD , there is very little of his solo piano music. Very little grand piano type music at all. Most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music. I was disapointed.&#34;,
 &#34;Need to proof read your work: This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don&#39;t work. The book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors. If you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.&#34;,
 &#39;NOT RECOMENDED DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER: hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip, i was really dissapointed, it wasnt even 3 minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get ON FIRE!!!! melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is VERY UNSAFE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY DONT PUT YOUR BABY IN DANGER IF YOU HAVE THIS PLUGGED IN YOUR CAR, CUS THE WARMER MIGHT GET ON FIRE, MINE DID!!!! i hope this review helps you, i wont EVER buy this product EVER again.&#39;,
 &#34;Waste of money: I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn&#39;t just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter).&#34;,
 &#34;It is what is......: West-West yall! This album is good for what it is meant to be, West coast Gangsta music. It&#39;s all about lowridin, smokin chronic, kickin&#39; it and gangbangin in the Golden State. Those who are accustomed to Down South music will probably not like some of the west coast funk. It&#39;s a different flavor for some. Me being from Cali, I love this stuff. It is rare that someone captures the essence of the west. I do agree with this not being the best album but it&#39;s still worth buying. It&#39;s got enough head-bangers to get you to the club. That&#39;s Cali-4-ya.... 3 1/2 stars&#34;,
 &#34;Erotic and Romantic... One of Anne&#39;s Best!: Exit to Eden is one of Anne&#39;s Best works, in my opinion. Many people were turned off by the film adaptation (why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me &lt;eg&gt;) but this book focuses on the relationship of Master and Slave and what happens when the tables are turned. Anne has many sides and Lestat is just one of them. True Rice Fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction.&#34;,
 &#34;Wonderful story coupled with steamy, erotic scenes.: This book was hard to put down. The story was excellent, and the erotic scenes were just as good. Like all of Anne&#39;s books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!&#34;,
 &#34;Stick with Sleeping Beauty: Perhaps in it&#39;s time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it&#39;s tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree. It&#39;s ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more, and turned into one of the worst movies you&#39;re likely to see. Ann Rice didn&#39;t deserve such treatment.There are books that capture the true essence of the BDSM fanatsy that are much more engrossing, and interestingly enough, Ms Rice has written them as well. (writing as A. N. Roquelaure, see her trilogy in the Sleeping Beauty series)&#34;,
 &#34;Vile from the beginning: Let me start by saying that I never put down a book, even if I don&#39;t like it. This is one that I couldn&#39;t even get past the first few pages. Maybe I didn&#39;t give it a chance, but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book. I&#39;m glad it was a free download on Kindle. I gave it two stars only because I didn&#39;t give it a chance to get better. If I hadn&#39;t deleted it, maybe I would give it another chance, but I certainly won&#39;t pay for it.&#34;,
 &#39;spirirt house. a boring bloody mess.: shame on me for buying it. shame on me for reading it. karen b. wisconsin&#39;,
 &#34;Spirit House: Read This In An Air-Conditioned Space: Reviewer: Renee S. NYC. August 13, 2008The plot is typical Noir, the hero typical world-weary and disillusioned Hammett orChandler, but the atmosphere is stunning!It was a whole new world for me and I fellcompletely into it from Vinnie&#39;s first nightmare to the final dripping conclusion.Mr. Moore&#39;s descriptions of Thailand andthe Thai people are evocative and real. Onecan feel the heat and humidity, see the swirlsand flashes of colors, and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages. And the story&#39;s not bad either. I was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in Bangkok - and the story&#39;s not bad either. There were a confusing numberof characters, some of whom did not advance the plot at all, and the plotting could have been tighter, but all-in-all I would definitely recommend the book. Just be sure you read it in an air-conditioned space, because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat!&#34;,
 &#39;I HATE THIS BOOK: I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!&#39;,
 &#39;Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at?: If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published&#39;,
 &#39;NOT THAT GOOD: Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.&#39;,
 &#34;Start memorizing this book.: I don&#39;t give very many things five stars.Bradbury&#39;s novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they&#39;re scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won&#39;t want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that.&#34;,
 &#39;dystopian classic: Wow, what a great book about a dystopian society, censorship, and the need of the state to keep the masses blind, deaf, and dumb. If you enjoyed &#34;1984&#34;, &#34;Brave New World&#34;, or &#34;The Giver&#34;, you must read this. It is now one of my favorites!&#39;,
 &#39;really good: this was a good book. the part called &#34;coca&#34;is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like &#34;the giver&#34; only a lot better.&#39;,
 &#34;What a classic: To be perfectly honest, I really don&#39;t understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader. Yes I know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages. Every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books, no matter what the content or agenda the story might contain.Anyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately. It&#39;s the best $.25 you will ever spend.&#34;,
 &#34;Didn&#39;t Like it!!: Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? Come on. Burning every book that exists, this isn&#39;t a look into the future. It&#39;s a look into Bradbury&#39;s twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don&#39;t waste your time.&#34;,
 &#39;A book with many levels: What appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books, with reflection is a comment on the systematic suppression of free thought and free speech. The book gives insight into how those who look the other way or are concerned with rights only as applied to them can actually further the loss of individual freedoms. A very thought provoking novel.&#39;,
 &#39;Fahrenheit 451: I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D&#39;,
 &#34;Great Book to read, but NOT to LISTEN to.: I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD. Ray Bradbury reads it, and it is very bad. It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off. He reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep. Someone needs to re-make the CD&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#34;DON&#39;T READ THIS MIND-NUMBING DRIVEL!: This book doesn&#39;t deserve one star. It deserves negative 1000 stars. This was the WORST book I have ever read. The book moved to slow, and the characters are stupid. Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman who sets books on fire, becuase homes are fireproof. Then he meets this crazy girl nmaed Clairese who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like (Did you know that one time billboards were only 20 feet long, instead of 200) WHO CARES?!?! If there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this.&#34;,
 &#39;Hardly even deserves 1 star: This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version, there is a forword and an introduction. Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?&#39;,
 &#34;Captivating language, needless to say amazing.: Being only a teenager, what I have to say usually means nothing, or gets no credit. I personally loved this book, reading it just a day ago. I was entirely captivated with the plot, and the idea of censorship in the future, and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable. What possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing. To actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing. I would recommend this to anyone. You don&#39;t need to love to read, just know how to read.&#34;,
 &#39;Ok: I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent!!! My #1 book of all time!!!: I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class, and fell in love with it. It\&#39;s simply chilling in it\&#39;s portrayal of the &#34;future&#34; and the deliberate ambiguity about Clarrise is very cool. The deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling. A very poignant book, it\&#39;s definitely a must-read.&#39;,
 &#39;Very important book: This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the &#34;dumbing of America&#34; that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country).&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;ll never go out of date: I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I\&#39;d never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn\&#39;t make much of an impression on me. I can\&#39;t remember why. But knowing the fault could\&#39;ve been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it\&#39;s famous, right?Well, folks, it\&#39;s famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It\&#39;s absolutely fantastic and I just plain can\&#39;t recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn\&#39;t matter. I can say &#34;transcends the genre&#34; with a straight face. Yes I can. I\&#39;ll be reading this one again, folks. I didn\&#39;t write it and I\&#39;m just sick with jealousy about it, okay?&#39;,
 &#39;Bleak, Blind, and Boring.: Being forced to read it in school for its &#34;so called&#34;relation to censorship (sp?) I would have to say !!BURN IT!! Althoughthe book is about censorship and why/how it is wrong I can\&#39;t say much good about it. The theme itself is good, but the story itself is trash. One of the most un-realistic ideas i\&#39;ve ever heard. First off, everyone in the country is an idiot. Second, that includes the hero. Third, even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence. And finally, way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itself.L8r.&#39;,
 &#39;Fahrenheit 451, Burning Up My Brain: I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering &#34;wait... what happened?&#34;. Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound.&#39;,
 &#34;Sadly a disappointment: Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other &#39;day-to-day&#39; readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury&#39;s tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than &#39;get something&#39; out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did.&#34;,
 &#34;F 451 shows how dangerous a person&#39;s ideas are.: I enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme .look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think. An individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general&#34;,
 &#34;A must read - especially for teenagers.: This is my first re-read of this book as an adult (I&#39;m now 46). I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter, age 14, and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read. My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too). It is hard to believe that this book was written in the 1950&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#34;poor reading: I bought this book on tape as read by the author. It is excruciating to listen to. Don&#39;t get this! I should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author!!&#34;,
 &#39;Good: &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world, instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe, firefighters burn entire houses containing books, and occasionally even people. One of these firefighters, Guy Montag, has doubts about the whole situation, and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan. The major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction. I would suggest everyone read this book at least once, to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance. I overall liked this book, and would give it a 4/5&#39;,
 &#34;Explains a lot of things from the movie: The book was not so good as the movie, but the book helps understanding some points that seemed totally random when I saw it.Compared to 1984 it&#39;s miles away, but still is really nice.&#34;,
 &#39;Fahrenheit 451: This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced. It was very confusing, especially the &#34;TV family&#34; which I did not understand at all. It is more of an adult book.&#39;,
 &#39;Fahrenheit %0ZERO0%: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray BradburyI didnt really like this book, it was all just people rambling on and on about how there life sucks, the whole worlds sucks, and burn books. I dont know how you could enjoy this book. People just talk to talk in this book. Its about a guy named montage that is a firefighter. He burns things instaed of putting fires out. He meets a wierdo girl who talks nonsense, this guy starts to think what hes doing starts reading books and gets caught. He then has to burn his books. He doesnt want to go to jail so he Runs away.&#39;,
 &#34;BURN THIS BOOK!: Hey A reader from MISSOURI, I hear you. This book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school. I have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for 40 years!!! I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won&#39;t have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!&#34;,
 &#39;A Very Dark and Mysterious Book: I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally, I hated the book.&#39;,
 &#34;I tried reading this book for my summer reading &amp; it was bad: I am sorry this book did not make any sense and I am a straight A student. If you have a choice I wouldn&#39;t pick this one.&#34;,
 &#39;WASTE OF MY TIME: first of all i was assigned to read this book for a class. it started out lame. and all it did was get worse. who cares about a firefighter who burns book. now come on, i could write a book, about books,ten times better then that. maybe if the books had names and talked then maybe it would of caught my attention.&#39;,
 &#39;This is the lamest book I have ever read: This book really sucks. It makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time. Ray should have had better things to do&#39;,
 &#34;Weird Weird Weird Weird!!!!!!: This book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring! The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV, but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the TV back on. I mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with 4 wall TVs, robot dogs, and burning books. And the story never really had an ending. It just stopped, I guess to end the boredom. I think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book. How else would it get on the required reading list? Maybe he gives 50% of the profits from sales. Please don&#39;t buy this book, you are supporting a lunatic.&#34;,
 &#39;real cranberries: I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound, elegance, quality, essence, delicate sadness and youth. It is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post XX century pop music.I do recomended.(...)&#39;,
 &#39;INTERESTING AND SAD! , BUT VERY WELL DONE!: This is very interesting film that is really five stories in one. A dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another. A great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time. The film is ultimately sad and depressing, but each story is very interesting. With a cast featuring Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong?&#39;,
 &#34;motorola phone car charger: product is great. works like it&#39;s supposed to. order processing and shipment speedy and efficient&#34;,
 &#34;It worked: Yep. Motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord. Has a convenient on off light that you&#39;ll never miss. It&#39;s big and bright.&#34;,
 &#34;Well made product at fair price: I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it&#39;s resellers charge.&#34;,
 &#34;Not so good: It works. That&#39;s the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places, exposing wire after only a month. My phone is telling me that I am using an unauthorized charger. So no, this was not a good purchase, and I do not trust the source.&#34;,
 &#34;battle weary: This game is horrible. The battles are so... long, slow and unexciting. The scenery is cute, but alittle dark for GBA.Don&#39;t waste your money.&#34;,
 &#34;chalinging game: this game is hard and I still havn&#39;t beaten it, and I have had it for two mothes. I reconmend for only skilled players play.DELTA 904thanks for youre time and patience&#34;,
 &#34;Horrible Game: This game is boring. You can&#39;t follow the story line, and if I hadn&#39;t read the books I would not understand it at all. The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring. In the mines of Moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug. The controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to. I have bought this game and I do not like it. I would suggest not buying it.&#34;,
 &#39;why oh why does anyone play this: Yes this has good graphics, Yes it has a kind of Zelda theme. But really if your looking for a game that fits the Lord of the rings best then get the Two Towers. Once you are used to that then get the The Return of the King. That is the best game of them all. Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have ! Please Gameboy dont let Vivendi Universal (the makers of this game) ever make a game based on a film ever again. They wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you. DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!&#39;,
 &#39;The Code of Dusty Fog: I have read the book and enjoyed it. It is not one of my favorites, but it fills in some of the story line. I will be rereading the book. I have all of the Floating Outfit series and am in the process of reading them in order instead of how I purchase them.&#39;,
 &#39;Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz: I won\&#39;t go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she\&#39;s so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character. Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy. The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further. That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character &#34;melts&#34;.....pun intended. I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ... I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I\&#39;ll get from the library.&#39;,
 &#39;I Kept Waking Up My Husband......: I was laughing so hard when I was reading this that I kept waking him up. I then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him up.This is a wonderfully funny book and I hope to read more books by Robin Wells.&#39;,
 &#39;High Quality For a Reasonable Price: I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire. It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions, there was no leakage or fogging. This case absolutely works as advertised.&#39;,
 &#39;Hallmark of the disposable society?: Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic. So, folks after 12 hours they are obsolete, and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last 10 millenia! Yay, hooray!&#39;,
 &#39;NO AVAILABILITY: My rating is for Amazon, not the product. I placed this order and just received a mail that it is not available. Why is the availability not updated? I still see it being available now. Very disappointing&#39;,
 &#39;poor quality DVD recording: movies are okay but the video quality is poor.Is this a legit DVD or black market?They are watchable...but grainy.I guess you get what you pay for.&#39;,
 &#39;Interesting View Into British Culture: As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented&#39;,
 &#39;Colin Firth...need one say more?: Ah! Colin Firth...the ultimate, consumate actor in a variety of roles. A delightful diet of films...one a day plus a bonus for the week-end and one can have a film festival all their own!!&#39;,
 &#39;Ones to watch over and over: Excellent classic style movies. All well acted with excellent stars. Will watch over again many times.Colin Firth is one of my favorites.&#39;,
 &#34;Sweet Revenge: This is the only film I have watched so far. This is not up to the usual British Cinema quality either in acting or content. I didn&#39;t watch to the end. Once he found himself tied up in bed I turned it off.&#34;,
 &#39;Not worth the great price: Paying about $16 for this collection of 8 films could have been a great buy. I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite, polished, reserved, and mannered. With the exception of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down A Mountain (the only redeeming film in this collection; Hugh Grant portrays the real British style well) the makers of the other 7 have obviously visited Hollywood too many times and have drunk their Kool-Aid. The courseness, vulgarity, even offensiveness in dumbed-down run-on dialogue, babbling idiotic nonsense, and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual British polish. The 7 films that lack class and levity of the usual British approach obviously came from the hog-pen of the U.S. cinema trough.&#39;,
 &#34;Warning. I HIGHLY don&#39;t recommend this set!: You would have NO idea reading the description, and looking at the picture on the front, but most of these movies have a rating of PG-13, and there&#39;s even an R!!!They are mostly about sex, sensuality, and the like.Yuck. I bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like Pride &amp; Prejudice and Emma, etc...These are NOT the same. I threw the set away without even opening it. The ratings are on the back. They should be written on the page.&#34;,
 &#39;Great card, better than expedcted...: Considering the price of this card, its hard to be disappointed. I installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of Windows XP. As I write this, I am watching an old episode of Star Trek TNG on a small screen on top of AOL. The capture feature works great and the the additional goodies...from cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional. I never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware, and the 8500DV was no exception. There is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install... I have found it reduces many hassles. Speaking of hassles, I have had none with this card. Windows XP is such an improvement for handling complex components like the 8500DV, I would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out Win 98 system. This card costs about the same as a prime 3D gaming card. It provides dramatic capabilities. ATI has really done a great job with this card. For the price....it cannot be beat.&#39;,
 &#34;Great card but difficult to setup: As the other reviews noted, there are problems with installing this card, even though I got it working successfully in the end. Although it isn&#39;t my top pick for a graphics card, I have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my VCR and print my digital videos to VHS (yes, this is possible, although it is a bit tricky to setup.)I withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup. If the user manual would have been more comprehensive, and if the ATI website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card, the whole nasty ordeal of card setup (that almost all night) might have been spared.&#34;,
 &#39;same: Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. &#34;12th rising&#34;, &#34;brimstone gate&#34;, but the songs off of Vittra all sound similar. I can\&#39;t really decipher between them. Most of the riffs aren\&#39;t capturing. It is hard to find the cd Diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already I can tell you that cd is better than Vittra.&#39;,
 &#34;Louie&#39;s Goose: A good childrens&#39; book, excellent for reading to pre-school aged children. The text can easily be understood by the 3 and 4 year olds in my library story hour as they identify with Louie and his most favorite stuffed animal, a red goose. The illustrations are great!&#34;,
 &#39;Trite story line with poor recipes: I was new to Guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city. But the story line was trite, even contrived. THe &#34;culinary&#34; part of the mystery included recipes that, while tasty, are hardly gourmet -- they mostly consisted of things made with Campbell\&#39;s soup. Not one that I recall was indigenous to Mexico. At least it was a quick read.&#39;,
 &#39;an unusual writing technique: Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, &#34;Ulysses,&#34; did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, &#34;Finnegan\&#39;s Wake,&#34; got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume.&#39;,
 &#39;self indulgent tripe: &#34;What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia;went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hooth&#34;If I wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel, no one would ever read it. If they did, they would correctly assume that I am, in fact, a pompous erudite fool. And by the way, I know that there are a million academics rating this book that will come on here and tell me how completely wrong my point of view is. But guess what?--I don\&#39;t care and I\&#39;ll never actually read any of your responses. Save it for your poor students and old, bearded friends wearing tweed jackets with elbow patches.To the rest of you (normal people)--stay away from this book.&#39;,
 &#34;My farts make more sense than Finnegans Wake: ye make a book, alas, how is life? Green Bay Packers. Sandwich? Baby. Eat the, President, lake.Like that prose? That is James Joyce. The king of gibberish. I made it up. But when he does it, it is a classic. When I do gibberish, it is not. Why?What the hell is going on with Finnegans Wake??? I don&#39;t know.Joyce must be the genious of gibberish.I don&#39;t get it.&#34;,
 &#39;Naked Emperors: Admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior. Such &#34;intellectuals&#34; are painfully desperate and afraid of reality; for it is only in the realm of the naked emperors that they can pretend to be hip.&#39;,
 &#39;Mad with Vanity: That was how English novelist Evelyn Waugh descibed Joyce when he came to write FW, and the judgment is apt. The book itself is tripe; but the contortions Joyce fans put themselves through to justify it are always a source of amusement.&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s challenging us to doodle...: I give this book two stars because it&#39;s the first, and last, book to tell us what we already should know...that we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep. Finningan&#39;s Wake reminds me of the canvas I&#39;ve seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint. Any one of us could create the same thing. Why don&#39;t we? Joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass. If you think it&#39;s worthwhile (personally, I don&#39;t) do it. You could be the next James Joyce.&#34;,
 &#39;Nietzsche is NOT the antichrist!: Nietzsche is not fed up with christianity, he is fed up with christians, and the people who distort christianity. Nietzsche is not the antichrist, he is simply the Messenger in a greek tragedy. We are the antichrist.&#34;In reality there has been ofnly one christian, and he died on the cross. The Evangel died on the cross. what was called \&#39;Evangel\&#39; from that moment on was already the oposite of what he had lived&#34;antichrist 39Five stars for Nietzsche, three for the lack of notes. Also, there are many times when Nietzsche writes in french or latin and there is no note or translation.ps I\&#39;m older than twelve.&#39;,
 &#39;Pocket chart: It is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet. It appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it.&#39;,
 &#34;Sraight-up raw emotions...: From a female hardcore lovers point of view: I have just got to say that Hatebreed is amazing. By far one of the best hardcore albums I&#39;ve heard in a while. THis album is full of raw, true emotion - it makes me aware of where I am with myself as well as with others. Hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound - they truly give it in a way that makes me FEEL the music. It has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back. I would love to thank the band personally for creating and SHARING thier sound with others...and for inspiring me.&#34;,
 &#34;I didn&#39;t know Sepultura was hardcore.: It&#39;s interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, when they now tour with bands like that. Its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna-metal band&#39;s, except without what little talent or melody those bands possess. This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura. I thought this was a joke band when I heard it. f you&#39;re really interested in hardcore, put down that jug of Weight Gainer 900, turn off your victory sampler CD, and order a Universal Order of Armadgeddon CD immediately. And stop wearing so much adidas, newjack.&#34;,
 &#39;Hatebreed is the god of all that is god about hardcore.: Hatebreed album Satifaction is the Death of Desire has to be one of the all time best albums I have ever heard. I list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer. If you are looking for strong lyrics, strong music, and an awsome groove that you and your friends can kill each other to, buy this and never stop listening to it.&#39;,
 &#39;Worse than &#34;The Quest&#34;: The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins, right? Unfortunately, the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies. At least Van Damme didn\&#39;t do the splits in this movie. Then again, that might have given the film a memorable momement.&#39;,
 &#34;I liked it, but my dog doesn&#39;t.: I had bought one of these for my old dog (a large German Shorthaired Pointer) who had a horrible pulling problem. And it worked perfectly for him, and he didn&#39;t seem to mind. On the other hand I just bought one of these for my 10 month old Coonhound, and it also worked to stop his pulling. But he hates it! I can&#39;t take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast 3-6 times. I think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up, but now I have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him. Other than that amazing product in it&#39;s self.&#34;,
 &#34;Imitation Brand: They sent an imitation; Holt from china instead of the advertised Halti, and it cut my dog&#39;s face! I tried contacting them, but no response.&#34;,
 &#34;Not good for small dogs like lhasas: This is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware! Because of their flatter facial structures, the collar slips off and won&#39;t hold as it should. And speaking from experience, the size is not the issue i.e. even a small size won&#39;t work.&#34;,
 &#34;The Wild Thornberry&#39;s Movie: This game is so cool. I have only played it once, and already I would like to purchase it. It has coloring, puzzling, and even adventures. The only time that I ave played was when I was going to a DNA lab, and I had my GBA, with a not-so-fun game, so somebody let me play The Wild Thornberry&#39;s Movie Game, and now I would like to purchase it, once again to say that.&#34;,
 &#39;Disappointed: I am sure the story is fine, but the disk is imperfect, lost my packing slip and need to call to return it.&#39;,
 &#39;stargate continuum: the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that I have bought&#39;,
 &#39;stargat continuam review by cvf: movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am REALLY HAPPY about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough&#39;,
 &#34;Very pleased!: As a loyal fan of the Stargate franchise since the very first movie...I applaud the actors, writers and producers/director for a job well done!It still takes some getting used to a &#39;feature-length movie&#39; vs &#39;made for television&#39;; meaning I was so used to them getting right to it, that I had to learn how to sit back, relax and let the actors take me there.I can only say that I was very satisfied with this purchase and I have a little bit more of Stargate in my home...where it belongs.Thanks!DarrylCincinnati, OH&#34;,
 &#39;2/3 done: I am pretty happy with installment 2 out of the 3 that were promised. I have been to a few conventions and have shaken hands with most of the stars, but I have a ways to go yet, and so do they! I am anxiously awaiting the next one.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s great to have SGC Back: I hope we&#39;ll see more of this mini movies, though it seems for a story like that, a 4 hours movie could have been better. Yet, it&#39;s a fantastic storyline, exploring new ways allowing us however to see all of our favorite teams seens over the years while the show was on.&#34;,
 &#39;Above expectation: The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.&#39;,
 &#39;Video Review: Length:: 6:20 MinsThis is my video Review of Stargate Continuum. For more video reviews, search &#34;MikePetel&#34; on Youtube. Enjoy!&#39;,
 &#34;Great movie butt o grainy on blueray: I like all the stargates. But this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd. Other then that it&#39;s another great stargate film.&#34;,
 &#39;one time cooker: This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.&#39;,
 &#39;The few standout tracks on this album are...: 1) The intro, &#34;soulstar.&#34;2) &#34;youloveme,&#34; which should have been the first single, not &#34;forthenight.&#34;3) Somewhere between &#34;momentinlife&#34; and &#34;thereason.&#34;Otherwise, a less than stellar album.&#39;,
 &#34;Soulstar - - Not Quite There Yet!: I got the feeling when I was listening to this album that he wasn&#39;t there musically or lyrically. The majority of this album is just passé and I could take it or leave it. Forthenight is the only song on here that gets major play in my cd player, and he couldn&#39;t even give you five minutes to really get into it. The other songs sound as if he was going off into left field. Now only if he could JustgivemeawholealbumIcouldlistentoo!&#34;,
 &#34;This cd is really cool..give him a break: I love Musiq ( even when he had the Soulchild, don&#39;t get me wrong all the songs aren&#39;t hits BUT for the most part he is doing his thing on this album. Cut my man a break, he is trying and I look forward to his new album. I love his voice, his music and him in general. The tracks that are my fav&#39;s are:InfatueightiesWhoknowsFortheNightYouknowyoulovemeMomentinlifeWomanopolyBuy, borrow(from a friend or Library) this Cd it&#39;s mellow like the way Neo-soul is supposed to be.Toodles,&#34;,
 &#34;Jusbeautiful: At first I didn&#39;t really care for this album, but after a couple of listens, I love it. Neo-soul is here to stay and Musiq is the greatest. My favorite tracks are Womanopoly, Babymother, Who Knows, and so on. This cd is hot and I can&#39;t wait for the next one.&#34;,
 &#34;ultimately ineffective: This is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer isn&#39;t talented enough to pull off what she&#39;s set out to do. Sad, since I was looking forward to reading this, based on the jacket copy. Oh well. This reviewer recommends that others look elsewhere for a compelling read.&#34;,
 &#39;Run Lola Run: This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen. If you are thinking about buying it just do so, you will not be disapointed.&#39;,
 &#34;What if!: This IS your bag:If you like action, fun, stunts, thrillIf you want to see something completely uniqueIf you are not afraid of timeblendsIf you like fabulous music from some of the hippest german people (that make look the far too streamlined usual scores look veeeery old)If you like cartoonsIf you like to rather sit and hold than to stop the vcr and go to toiletIf you like to experience sheer SPEEDSo, what are you waiting for? Run to get it!One funny sidenote: The movie&#39;s rating was for 12 years in germany. Americans are really funny with their prudery. It seems that the americans are as afraid of sex as the germans are of violence.&#34;,
 &#39;My favorite movie ever: this movie is simply the best i have ever seen. i am very into film, but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line, a great art direction, and wonderful camera work...all out A++++movie...everyone should have it!&#39;,
 &#39;A bit overrated. . .: Actually this isn\&#39;t really even a movie, it\&#39;s a really long music video. Maybe it\&#39;s an advertisement, I don\&#39;t know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing\&#39;s really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the &#34;alternate-scenario&#34; theme just didn\&#39;t work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point. Is there a point? Somebody please enlighten me.&#39;,
 &#34;Achtung!: This movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath. Once just wasn&#39;t enough in the theater. I just had to see it again on the big screen. I never used to be into movies with subtitles. But the effect just isn&#39;t the same as it is in its native tongue. Just when I thought it&#39;s over, it just takes you on another turn and another and another!!! If you like fast paced, unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove, this one&#39;s for you.&#34;,
 &#39;Good for Hip and Knee joints in my Bichons: This product is palatable and seems to work well with my Bichon, who injured her knee in a tussle with my younger Bichon. The joint works well and she seems to not have anymore pain. I recommend this product.&#39;,
 &#39;RELLY CHALINGING.: RELLY QUICK action you can play tag here is how to play tag youhave to tag all the othere cars wethowt being tagd in retern.batell is a chalinging game you fite. you can race to.&#39;,
 &#39;Just another excuse to make money: I am sorry but after reading this book, I have to admit that the feminists are right. Men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make money.The book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet. It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible. In fact I doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate, it would be inspite of the tips not because of them.An entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women, though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types, then the list over 10 to watch out for.I am glad I did not actually pay for this, I would have demanded my money back.&#39;,
 &#34;10 stars!: This album is brilliant! If you buy it, I guarantee it&#39;ll be the best album you buy all year!&#34;,
 &#34;Disappointing: This was a very disappointing purchase. The &#39;Premium Hand Decorated Exotic Wooden Tea Chest&#39; appears to be pine decorated with printed paper. Although the print is very nice, the description of it is a bit overblown.The tea inside was okay. Some of the combinations of flavors just didn&#39;t go well together, and often drowned the flavor of the tea.&#34;,
 &#39;Thank goodness for Amazon!: My cable was out, and I missed my favorite shows. Thank goodness for Amazon where I could watch them and not worry about viruses or signing up for a monthly fee. Thanks!&#39;,
 &#39;Joshua &amp; Children: This is an easy reading, but profound, story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders.&#39;,
 &#34;Nice CD, but mislabelled: This CD is not Touch Sampler 5, which has not yet been released. This is Touch Sampler 00, released to commemorate the millenium. It&#39;s a nice CD, and the track listing is right, but the product title is incorrect. See [...]&#34;,
 &#39;Colleen - Colleen Et Les Botes À Musique: I can\&#39;t imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern, and it doesn\&#39;t deviate from that at all. But Colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again. By mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their re-processed and synthesized counterparts, she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism. &#34;What\&#39;s is a Componium, Part 1&#34; goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end. And even it &#34;Charles\&#39;s Birthday Card&#34; relies solely on iterations of Pop Goes the Weasel, &#34;Will You Gamelan For Me?&#34; is its own creation immediately. The tinkling comes fast and furious on &#34;What\&#39;s is a Componium, Part 2,&#34; a track that sparkles like moondust. &#34;Calypso in a Box&#34; shows off the more processed side, and has an almost Senor Coconut feel for its short running time. The standout piece here is the final track, &#34;I\&#39;ll Read You a Story,&#34; which appeared on an earlier album, but is always welcome anywhere.&#39;,
 &#39;McDuffie\&#39;s elegance and artistry are marvelous.: I knew nothing of Robert McDuffie until I heard him perform the Mendelssohn Concerto at Wolf Trap with the National Symphony. That performance led me to seek out this CD, and McDuffie\&#39;s playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance. His tone may not be as big as Itzhak Perlman\&#39;s, but it is nevertheless exquisite (the phrase &#34;spun silver,&#34; though cliched, is apt). This is true concerto playing, the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra (and, by extension, with the listener). I definitely will seek out more of McDuffie\&#39;s discs, and I hope others will, too.&#39;,
 &#39;Great value, brute force: First off let me help you novices out there a little bit. Don\&#39;t buy a video card because of its price, its hype, or its look, do your research! This card is excellent, it is blazingly fast, (it beats geforce 3), and it is a steal... BR&gt;A key feature in the radeon 8500 is the programmable pixel shaders. Let me tell you a little more about them. Geforce 3, 4 and radeon 8500 all share them witht he exception with the Geforce 4 MX. The newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you don\&#39;t have a video card that uses this, then you can\&#39;t play it. The radeon beats its competition while being half the price! but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ATI and what seems to be &#34;cheating drivers&#34;Pros:blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons:driver issues&#39;,
 &#39;Not a horror movie, a horrible movie: This movie personifies everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days. The characters are superficial, the plot anemic, and the special effects vastly overused. Liam Neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction. The house is possessed by the spirit of its builder, who hates kids. That is about it. A terrible remake of the original 1963 classic, which was the best horror film ever made. Get the original, and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot.&#39;,
 &#34;Absolute Crap!: Okay, if you&#39;re a special effects freak, you might like this. However, there are much better films with equally good effects. If you&#39;re a fan of minor things like say, oh... plot, character development, etc., then stay away! The 1963 Robert Wise film is the scariest film I&#39;ve ever seen, and the scares come from what Wise DOESN&#39;T show you. The &#39;63 version was brilliantly plotted and paced, with one of the greatest ending lines in film history. The 1999 version has none of this. Do yourself a favor, and see the &#39;63 movie, or better yet, read the Shirley Jackson novel. The only reason this gets one star is because C. Zeta-Jones is just SO easy on the eyes!&#34;,
 &#39;A Truley Horrible Horror Film: A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special &#34;special effects&#34; attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that\&#39;s scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it.&#39;,
 &#34;Too awful to be funny: I&#39;ll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn&#39;t even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn&#39;t know who she was - she hadn&#39;t married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of &#39;worst&#39; things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It&#39;s dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare&#34;,
 &#39;Catherine Zeta-Jones trap!: Is &#34;The House On Haunted Hill&#34; so different than &#34;The Haunting&#34;? Both share the same failure. A great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good THRILLER. But this movie makes it no better than a poor picture!Good actors, good story but not well told with its poor suspense! The old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful!!!&#39;,
 &#34;Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick: If you like super-natural mysteries, then you&#39;d like this film. It is technically a horror film, but it&#39;s really not that frightening (though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet), and as a result, is not for people that watch horror films for the fright. As a mystery, however, it is really quite good, and deserves to be watched over and over, just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end.&#34;,
 &#39;...and what a feeble haunting it is!: No, no, no! What went wrong? Big-budget film with great actors, and what do we get? A visually appealing film with a completely flat Liam Neeson and a paper-thin storyline. Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a &#34;horror&#34; movie, is it?I just can\&#39;t believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you\&#39;re into &#34;stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive&#34; movies. Then you\&#39;ll se how a proper haunting should be :)&#39;,
 &#39;Great - then ZZZZZZ - then EGADS, what a waste!: Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a much higher caliber actress, along with Liam Neeson\&#39;s lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime.... almost as if the movies\&#39; set was haunted!The beginning of the movie has so much promise - you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise, you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer - then, and without warning, the silliness begins.It is as if you\&#39;ve been thrown into an Addams Family reunion - the story line starts to wander, the characters continue to wander, and ideas and solutions pop-up without a warning or explanation...To say a &#34;horror&#34; movie isn\&#39;t believable almost sounds absurd, but this movie gets you suckered in, then throws you on the floor flat...This is a definite - do not buy, borrow or rent! Just wait for cable!&#39;,
 &#39;Poor plot: The actors in the movie are a great bunch, but when the plot is very weak, you dont get very much. I mean Liam Neeson! Hes a great actor, but was very weak in this movie. it wasnt scary at all, the the end of the movie was bad. There was maybe one scary part, which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump. That was all. I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies, b/c it was a polar opposite.&#39;,
 &#39;Catherine Zeta-Hipboots: A fan of both Jackson\&#39;s novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don\&#39;t creep me out. They\&#39;re just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones\&#39;s leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (&#34;I\&#39;ve got the save the children!&#34; Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that\&#39;s possible. Let\&#39;s just put it this way: I just sacrificed 10 minutes of my time to write this review so that you won\&#39;t waste 1 hour and 40 minutes of yours on this film.&#39;,
 &#39;Typical Hollywood pulp: Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me.&#39;,
 &#39;EMBARASSINGLY BAD: This is the worst film of all time. The only amusement came from making fun of the acting. How they got Liam Neeson and Zeta Jones to be in this movie is incredible. I was looking forward to bathroom breaks so I would miss some of this movie. Total poop!!&#39;,
 &#39;IF IT AIN\&#39;T BROKEN, DON\&#39;T FIX IT: &#34;The Haunting&#34; with Julie Harris was so good--even better for its black and white medium, which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off-kilterness of the set. Why don\&#39;t they remake &#34;The Wizard Of Oz?&#34; Now, there\&#39;s a picture that could be made MUCH pertier with modern cinematography. The cheap set and old theatre-style acting throw a damper on what\&#39;s still is a great universal story.&#39;,
 &#39;Sadly Disappointing: This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title, it would have worked. The special effects (though good) were too much for this movie to bare.&#39;,
 &#39;It may be a modern-day classic to some, but not to me...: This 1999 horror film based on the original &#34;The Haunting&#34;, is creepy in some ways, but altogether, it\&#39;s not really a great film at all. It has good acting, and the scares and pop-outs are clever (things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2), with an ending that isn\&#39;t perfect, but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart. The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it\&#39;s intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn\&#39;t horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool. The complete storyline was pretty good, also. If you want some innovative horror from 1999, I suggest you get &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34;.&#39;,
 &#34;Poor re-make of a good movie: I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie, but after I did, I wish I hadn&#39;t spent the money. The story is lame, the actors dull, and the story is so changed from Shirley Jackson&#39;s wonderful book, and the 1963 movie that it doesn&#39;t even deserve to share the same title. Forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older &#39;Haunting.&#39; You&#39;ll wonder why they bothered to make a re-make, proving that newer doesn&#39;t necessarily mean better.&#34;,
 &#34;A lot better than the factory seat.: The seat was a cinch to install. It took about 10 minutes tops, and it&#39;s a lot more comfortable than the factory seat the bike came with.&#34;,
 &#39;Great story: I bought this book and Alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago. I was so happy to have it to download and read again on my Kindle!&#39;,
 &#34;Please the parents and the kids: Our almost 3-year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart, our 15-month old perks up when ralph is on, and we parents hum the tunes and enjoy the smart lyrics - even though we hear this music daily ! The music is rich and doesn&#39;t go stale, and manages to bridge the generation gap.&#34;,
 &#34;too small for a newborn: I ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was. I wanted to use it for a wkend trip I was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was. I have a 3 month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it. I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn&#39;t even able to fit a change of clothes. I tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky. All in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.&#34;,
 &#39;book review: Book is packaged properly so it is not easy to tamper with it. Great that it comes with a CD.&#39;,
 &#39;A great buy: This book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time. My daughters score improved tremendously!&#39;,
 &#39;helped a bit: studied the asvab few days before taking the test. this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test. the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab, so it helped me to study harder versions. passed with a score of 94.&#39;,
 &#39;A Surprising Find: The composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the 19th century. Their attempt was to create an &#34;American music&#34; from native American sources of rhythm and tonality. I get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as I got the first time I heard Erik Satie. The songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh. Don\&#39;t expect much in the way of tom-toms and movie indian harmonies. I love to find songs that go to unexpected places. I found that here.For a much more sophisticated review, search &#34;American Indianists&#34; and Fred Flaxman.&#39;,
 &#39;5 for the 1st, 4 for the 2nd: While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can\&#39;t watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, &#34;accidental&#34; murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.&#39;,
 &#39;Make sure you see Jean de Florette first: This is the second part of a two part series, and picks up where Jean de Florette leaves off. If you do not see Jean de Florette, then you will be missing much of the background of this movie, and the context is important. For example, without viewing the first movie, the viewer will not know Manons background, what happened to her father, and their farm. The viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the Soubeyran clan.The quality of the DVD picture is avarage. The picture is fairly clean and clear.&#39;,
 &#39;Does not work with Minolta DiMAGE 7i digital cam: I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC, but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam. I guess SimpleTech must be aware of the problem since their tech support e-mailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one, but of course I had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card, so I hope this might help some potential buyers...&#39;,
 &#34;Will Die, Don&#39;t Buy: It&#39;s very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this drive, 4 USB sticks, 3 SD cards, and 1 CF card. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache.&#34;,
 &#39;My favorite book of all-time: I can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me, reading them in a bookstore in Albuquerque. Inventive, humane, human, magical.&#39;,
 &#39;Simply Superb.: I have read this book in both Spanish and English I believe it is simply the best novel written in the 20th century. No where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one. It touches my soul with a something magical, creating the world of the Buendias inside of me. Someone once said finishing the book is like waking from a dream. I agree.&#39;,
 &#34;This Book Changed My Life: Before reading this book,I had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting. This book is akin to beauty bound in pages, it is utterly amazing. I personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through. I couldn&#39;t put it down, it simple spoke to me. Rules to follow while reading this: 1.) Pay attention and savor, and 2.) Open your mind&#34;,
 &#39;Macondo, la capital del mundo: Gracias a este libro recien llegamos a descubrir que toda la humanidad habito en algun momento en Macondo. Olvidensen de las grandes civilizaciones del pasado, este pueblo perdido lo abarca todo, amor, odio, guerras. Y los Buendia son como cualquier ser humano de este planeta. Esta novela son de las que se leen de un tiron, no importa que afuera pase un viento huracanado como el que destruye al pueblo al final. Al cerrar la ultima pagina todos llevamos algo de Macondo dentro de nosotros.&#39;,
 &#39;Too Boring to Continue: I only made it to 195 pages. The book is just boring. A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don\&#39;t care about the characters. If you don\&#39;t care about the characters, then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull. Like dusty butterflies in a catalog, their various lives are chronicled. It\&#39;s a dry description of their adventures and I\&#39;m left with a &#34;so what?&#34; Maybe his dryness passes for sophistication, but this book left me cold.&#39;,
 &#34;Columbian family values: Marquez&#39; book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can&#39;t overcome his predilictions.&#34;,
 &#34;500 pages of boredom: The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It&#39;s enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that&#39;s another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don&#39;t move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez&#39; book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores.&#34;,
 &#39;my #1 book: this book changed me ... it changed the way i look at things ... the way i observe all the events in my life ...it wasnt easy to read at the beginning ... but this book helped me get rid of depression ...writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot&#39;,
 &#39;You must read this book!: This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it! The Buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing I have encountered in any book. A must read.&#39;,
 &#34;Emporer&#39;s new clothes.: I&#39;m one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so I plugged away hoping I&#39;d experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have found...but I just didn&#39;t get it. Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I prefer a little dialog in my fiction...even in my heavy, pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction. I don&#39;t mind the magic realism, but I do get bored with sentences that run on for two-plus pages without a period. Oh, well, chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck who&#39;s educated beyond his intelligence. But I was underwhelmed.&#34;,
 &#39;U will never read anything like it: I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic. It feels weary and long at moments, also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul. Must have.&#39;,
 &#34;One of the best ever.....: I have read this book 4 times, and I can read it 100 times more, and never get tired of it. This is what a great piece of literture can do. This book has such unforgetable scenes, that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story, but takes over your mind and don&#39;t let go till you set aside the book. And even after, you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece.&#34;,
 &#34;A Haunting and Incredible Experience: I approached this novel with reluctance. A friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original Spanish. I don&#39;t understand Spanish, but I decided to try the English translation. I was overwhelmed. For days I was in a trance. I could not and did not want to pull myself away from Macondo and the Buendia family. The words hypnotized me. The scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a masterpiece in any language.&#34;,
 &#39;lesson in the depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself &#34;Wow! This seems like a great story!&#34; I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez\&#39; technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character\&#39;s life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man\&#39;s depravity. I realized that every person, without God\&#39;s intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez\&#39; perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula\&#39;s strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....&#39;,
 &#34;Could never read this book....: This is what I think my problem is... I didn&#39;t like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English, I would sit there and say to myself that I loved the descriptive, but not the flow of the sentence. I am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews. It has been a few years and I feel it is well deserving.&#34;,
 &#39;Excellent translation of Marquez\&#39;s masterpiece: This translation of Marquez\&#39;s quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years\&#39; symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration, political upheaval, and social transition. One criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical, cultural, or social elements of life in Colombia in the past two centuries.&#34;Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude&#34; (p. 199).Overall, a great read!&#39;,
 &#34;great card: This card has to be the bast purchase I&#39;ve ever made! The grapghics are great, it&#39;s DirectX supported (a biggie) and is far superior to most cards of the same price. The reviewer who says it doesn&#39;t work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card. If he bought the AGP card, maybe he should try the PCI. Anyway, this is a great video card from a great company for a great price. BUY IT!&#34;,
 &#34;The best discworld novel; for beginners or veterans: I&#39;ve read nearly all of them and this is my favorite. Definitely check out the ones with Death in a lead role (like Mort for instance)&#34;,
 &#39;Pratchett I just love him: the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books I have ever read. I almost have to read them alonme because I get the whole family looking askingly when I laugh out loud. Great stories, obviousl;y fantasy but so real. And if you love word play you will never find better&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll second that: I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version. There is no indication in the record. I was really looking forward to these CDs.&#34;,
 &#39;Carrot, Vimes, Colon and Nobbs are all back to fight crime!: Carrot, Vimes, Colon, Nobbs are back. With also alot of new recruits:Angua, Detritus and Cuddy. What is the mysterious thing killing dwarfs, clowns and assasins? Is Vimes finally going to get married? Who knows?&#39;,
 &#39;Terrible product, did not work, and company unreachable.: I purchased this item for my son, and it did not work right out of the box. I followed all the terrible instructions, and it still did not work. I went to the Coby website for answers, and there was nothing there either. I then attempted over 20 tiems to contact Coby via telephone, and was never able to get through. I finally returned the product for a different bran. I STRONGLY suggest buying something else with a longer battery life. and MUCH better support and documentation.&#39;,
 &#34;Where are the other seasons?: This is one of my favorite shows. I have contacted Sony for a release date, but I can&#39;t seem to get a difinitive answer. This has been out for almost 2 years. Please post a response if anyone knows what to do or who to contact to request the other seasons be released. I&#39;ll sign a petition if that will help!!!L.W.&#34;,
 &#39;Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable: I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth. There is no connection between the middle-English and its translation.That was a wasted 5.99 USD for kindle version and a HUGE disappointment :( ...&#39;,
 &#39;Beware of editions by General Books LLC: Beware of editions by General Books LLCThey produce books by scanning (OCR) copyright-free material, but without any editing.There are so many errors though that the result may be unusable.Usability probably depends on subject matter, but the many OCR-errors make even prose an annoying read.Especially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbled.See the review of J.M. Keynes\&#39; &#34;A treatise on probability&#34; on this site which I bought but is useless, and similar comments by other buyers (on &#34;Vanity Fair&#34; by Thackeray; on &#34;The Italian&#34; by Radcliffe)&#39;,
 &#34;Kindle version is very poorly edited: The content - introductory notes, translation - is great. This is one of my favourite adaptations of the Canterbury Tales into modern English.The Kindle version, however, complete ruins the book. The printed version presents facing-page translation, which works great. The kindle version attempts to do that, having one &#39;page&#39; after the other, not considering that due to the font-size adaptability, this doesn&#39;t work at all.&#34;,
 &#39;Aaarrrggghhh: Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon, and a second disappointment. Perhaps I should not shop online. Regardless, it is a classic and, I suspect, not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it.&#39;,
 &#34;Cnnterbury Tales(Oxford Word&#39;s Classics): This translation allows you to read the stories, which often are in poetry, with pleasure. I found the stories to be earthy, funny, but sometimes sad.&#34;,
 &#39;Great movie, poor audio transfer: It is so incredibly disappointing that when such a fine film is released on DVD that the audio would be out of synch. Does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings?&#39;,
 &#34;Tedious and Self-Inflating: I&#39;m always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard&#39;s expeditions. On top of that, it&#39;s not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can&#39;t carry the deadweight of Pelligrino&#39;s attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It&#39;s the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting. PASS.&#34;,
 &#39;This is GOLD!: Jenna Reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish. This young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording. Stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard. Fiddle playing of the highest order&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent fiddle: I really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable. There is a good range of tunes, which fit together well as a whole. I think I listened to it about 6 times in a row when I first got it.&#39;,
 &#39;This Coyote Is No Genius: The usual Girl Goes To The Big City cliches, not as bad as what you\&#39;d expect from Mr. Bruckheimer, thanks to the lovely and charismatic Ms. Perabo and a nice performance from Mr. Goodman as &#34;Dad&#34;...still, a gal who aspires to write songs and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY. That whole Whitney/Mariah thing, yecch.The bar scenes have a certain energy to \&#39;em, but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams (or personalities).Here\&#39;s hoping the adorable Piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future. I will definitely be following her career.&#39;,
 &#39;Good movie + these Coyotes aren\&#39;t ugly!: This is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like. However if your boyfriend doesn\&#39;t like these types of movies then put in the &#34;unrated version.&#34; In the regular version the kissing/sex scene doesn\&#39;t show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy. It\&#39;s definitely a cutesy movie, but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching. Piper Perabo and the rest of the girls won\&#39;t disappoint I promise!&#39;,
 &#34;The bar scenes were cool, but that&#39;s about it: I bought this movie because I love Jerry Bruckheimer movies. I should have just rented it. The only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes, all of which were shown in the trailer. That about sums up the good scenes. When I watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find Piper Perabo, I couldn&#39;t believe it! Perabo&#39;s acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me. Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded. I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling! I&#39;m one of those people who like all kinds of movies, even some really bad ones, but this is one that I don&#39;t think I will be watching again.&#34;,
 &#39;Coyote Stupid: This movie is so dumb... &#34;HOW DUMB IS IT?&#34; This movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative. Dumb, Dumb, DUMB.Did I mention that it stunk too.&#39;,
 &#39;Absolutely horrible!: This movie is one of the worst I\&#39;ve seen in the past year (right there with &#34;The Whole Nine Yards&#34; and &#34;Cruel Intentions&#34;). The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn\&#39;t any good), and there\&#39;s really no good reason to watch it. See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&amp;A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there\&#39;d be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it. However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie. What a waste of my time!&#39;,
 &#39;Great Movie: I love this movie,i watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie&#39;,
 &#34;Stunning: I bought this cd initialey by mistake. I was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it. It must have been God&#39;s hand directing me to this stunning album. I had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked. I sat there and let Shirley Manson&#39;s rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd. I went out immeadiately and found their first cd, which was just as good, but in a different way. That is what makes this a great band (among other things). THe ability to reinvent without loosing the soul/sound of the music.Two great albums. I can only hope that they grace us all with many more.&#34;,
 &#39;A must have. Not a bad song on the albumn.: this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting, it my advice is to go buy it. go spend a measly 15 bucks to get it, its well worth the money.&#39;,
 &#34;Rocks. Best. Get it.: Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can&#39;t stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also, this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too.&#34;,
 &#39;GREAT: Garbage rocks. Shirley Manson has a uniqe voice which is great. The music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.&#39;,
 &#39;the album grows on me...: I bought Garbage\&#39;s first album first and I thought the album was great, boasting good tracks like Milk, Queer, Only Happy When it Rains, but the sophomore album was even better. \&#39;Temptation Waits\&#39; started out with Manson\&#39;s menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like, &#34;I tell you something, I am a wolf but, I like to wear sheep\&#39;s clothing.&#34; The second track had a rockier edge to it, and then slowed down with \&#39;Medication\&#39;. And then it was fun all the way till &#34;You Look So Fine&#34; which ended the album with a sombre note, like how Garbage ended its first title with &#34;Milk.&#34;A great buy, almost perfection - you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest.&#39;,
 &#39;Shirley...yum: Garbage is a band like no other. You really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album.This album is packed FULL of classic Garbage songs that can really give you the chills. The opening track &#34;Temptation Waits&#34; was very eerie the first time I heard it and I loved it. The next track &#34;I Think I\&#39;m Paranoid&#34; has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for, love the lyrics too.A great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru Garbage. A word of advice though...don\&#39;t bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fan...defienatley not impressive.&#39;,
 &#39;Shirley &amp; The Boys Do It Again: Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album, 1998\&#39;s &#34;Version 2.0&#34;. Another mix of crunching guitars, wild beats, groovy keyboards &amp; effects, and the sensual voice of Shirley Manson, the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock, with such great, rockin\&#39; tracks as &#34;Temptation Waits,&#34; &#34;I Think I\&#39;m Paranoid,&#34; &#34;Push It,&#34; and my personal fave, &#34;Sleep Together.&#34; There\&#39;s also playful pop-rock with &#34;Special&#34; (with Shirley tipping her hat to the Pretenders\&#39; Chrissie Hynde at the end), the delirious &#34;Hammering In My Head,&#34; and the truly gorgeous &#34;You Look So Fine.&#34; Fabulous music &amp; production from a fabulous band, &#34;Version 2.0&#34; is essential Garbage.&#39;,
 &#34;Great show: Been watching this show on DVD since I got it. It made me even make want to get season 8 in the store which I did. It&#39;s a great show, one of my fav shows&#34;,
 &#39;GREAT: AFTER RECIVING THE 7TH SEASON SET AND IT WOULD NOT WORK...I MADE A SHORT PHONE CALL AND HAD A REPLACEMENT THE VERY NEXT DAY...WOW, WHAT SERVICE....MY GRAND-DAUGHTER ALSO THANKS YOU!!!&#39;,
 &#34;absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie: Disregard stories about how Hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true. Or about Redgrave&#39;s protest at the Oscars. Both apparently true (certainly the second one is). Just see this movie because it&#39;s simply one of the best movies and stories of all time. The script and acting are both top-notch.&#34;,
 &#34;Julia: If you like Jane Fonda or Vannassa Redgrave you&#39;ll like this movie.The content is dark but considering it&#39;s WWII that won&#39;t be a surprise. The movie is touching,sad,and in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far we&#39;d go in the name of friendship.&#34;,
 &#34;Review of JULIA: DVD arrived quickly and safely - good srvice would use these folk again. No problems encountered.First saw this film in the early 70&#39;s at a seaside picture plcae on the East Coast of England (Bridlington). Was charmed by thew story and the actors... Loved the moody scenery... The DVD reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable...&#34;,
 &#34;Glich Heaven: I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend&#39;s and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that&#39;s what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one&#34;,
 &#34;Wonderful flow: What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I&#39;ll be surfing by summer!&#34;,
 &#39;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !: There are many better yoga dvds to choose from. As a surfer, there is no special &#34;surf yoga&#34; as opposed to &#34;regular&#34; yoga. Any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit. Peggy\&#39;s videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury. It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community. A better option is Shiva Rhea\&#39;s Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a &#34;yoga matrix&#34; which allows you to create your own unique routines. Most DVDs become stale after awhile, but the yoga matrix on Shiva Rhea\&#39;s dvd (in addition to the 4 ready-made routines), prevent this DVD from ever getting old.&#39;,
 &#39;Another Bogus &#34;How to be a better surfer DVD.&#34;: This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don\&#39;t need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout. If you don\&#39;t know yoga, it\&#39;s useless. The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it\&#39;s great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga. In some scenes you can\&#39;t even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the &#34;instructor&#34; says what to do. Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing. Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video.&#39;,
 &#34;dont do it: If you know anything about yoga, do not buy this cd. The only positive parts is the location and view of the waves. This is more a novelty than useful. Honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipeline..Try Ali McGraw&#39;s Video for a great intermediate yoga tape.&#34;,
 &#39;no book key: I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA, required by my profesora.It didn\&#39;t have any book key... so now i have to return it. And just buy the one from the bookstore, like I should have done from the beginning.Also UPS was a day late, and didn\&#39;t leave the book as I requested by signing the &#34;LEAVE PACKAGE&#34; form left by the delivery man. I had to go pick it up myself because I\&#39;m never at home.&#39;,
 &#39;Needs some modification: This thing is ok. But realize, you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work. Therefore you need 2 people to blow out your pipes. When you are blowing out an rv, constant air pressure is the key. So, saying that, i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it. Now I just screw this on, attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and I no longer need to hold it in place.&#39;,
 &#39;Nigerians! An Industrious People: When I selected this book I was looking for a book I could share with young children, ages 5 years and up, to give them a glimpse of Nigeria, its people and culture. I liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions/lifestyles in Nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions. For example, the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in Nigeria for such outfits. Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties. All in all, it paints Nigerians as an industrious people, which is what we are.&#39;,
 &#34;If you love the songs on Noddy, DON&#39;T BUY!!: My son was very excited as we put the CD in the player! But when the music started, he was very unhappy!! The songs don&#39;t sound anything like the ones on the show. The melody and pace are different- and the performers aren&#39;t interesting. DON&#39;T BUY if you are familiar with the &#39;REAL&#39; songs.&#34;,
 &#34;Nice Experience.: This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou&#39;s music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on, I knew I would like my favorites, Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side, but I found myself enveloped in the other songs, which I had never heard before. I was a casual Lou Reed Fan.I think if I liked it, then a real hardcore fan will love it.The video is high quality and the sound is great, it&#39;s like having a front row seat. I&#39;m glad I purchased this one.&#34;,
 &#34;A rebuttal ...: ... to Jazzie of Hampstead, London. Don&#39;t know what you were looking at. Your last graf, where you make up some quote from Lou at the end of the show, is totally bogus. In fact, Lou says just the opposite. Pay no attention to that innacurate review. Lou has his good nights and his bad nights. This was one of the best performances of his career.&#34;,
 &#39;Native American Herbal Remedies: So far I really like it. It\&#39;s very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper. It\&#39;s difficult to &#34;flip through the book&#34; and find what you need. But I am fairly new to Kindle so maybe it\&#39;s just me. Or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand. But I do recommend it in whichever form you prefer.&#39;,
 &#34;blleeuurrgghhhh: i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs, you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it&#39;s way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity. For kylie minogue i can find many uses - for her music i find none.&#34;,
 &#39;Dad is in Trouble: This movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer team.They switch teams without their mom nowing.&#39;,
 &#34;can&#39;t stand those male co-stars: I think this movie was great! I just couldn&#39;t stand the bad acting of the guy mary-kate&#39;s character liked. He seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking. yuck!&#34;,
 &#34;bad acting: This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney, and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship. The olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch. This movie is unrealistic that Emma (ashley) and Sam Mary Kate were on 2 different teams. (It&#39;s a rule that siblings be on same sports team) This movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot.&#34;,
 &#34;Switching Goals - a very good movie: Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie, but it wasn&#39;t as funny or had as good of acting as the others. This movie is good to watch a couple of times, but only a couple times. If you have extra cash though, I say get it. You won&#39;t regret it.&#34;,
 &#39;Entertaining, but freaky: My son wanted this video so we got it. There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL. Maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is NOT real would be good.&#39;,
 &#39;Will bore you to death: Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.&#39;,
 &#34;A good book: I really liked this book. The characters were intersting and the relationship Sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother. The book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#39;Not happy: I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????&#39;,
 &#39;Nice suit.: It is a great suit, great buy, great service all around! I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a Frosty suit to buy one of these.&#39;,
 &#34;Worst test prep book I have ever used.: As other reviewers have suggested, this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn&#39;t already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious, but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time.&#34;,
 &#34;preliminary review: I just began using this book to review for the GRE in April. I haven&#39;t gotten very far into the book, but in the first 15 pages I have already found four seriously misleading errors (and that&#39;s just the ones I&#39;ve caught!). Some of the equations (even the Henderson-Hasselbalch) they provide are wrong. There is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation. You can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the GRE, but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks.&#34;,
 &#39;Wild Wild West: This is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The Best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do&#39;,
 &#34;Isn&#39;t there a larger version of this game??: This is too small for the age of child it&#39;s designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus, it didn&#39;t survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke.&#34;,
 &#39;Disappointed: My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However, after 2 rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down. Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I. Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s great when it works: I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well, after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth. Not too much fun there. I feel I wasted my money.&#34;,
 &#34;the bad quality doesn&#39;t ruin the concert: yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert, bad quality or not. I&#39;m only 16 and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity. I believe the Ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting, adrogyny is the only way to go!&#34;,
 &#39;Goodfun: Imagine action films were 30 minutes long. There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or &#34;No! You go on without me ...&#34;. All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill\&#39;s book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory, fact and example which is the style of O\&#39;Reilly\&#39;s authors. This book cuts to the chase, and it works.You see, Tomcat is a servlet runner. It isn\&#39;t that interesting or even the best of breed (Jetty is way better). Tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it, and Goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodies.Its a bit like a night tour of Naples on the back of an Italian cigarette smuggler\&#39;s Vespa. Somehow, at the end, despite not having understood much, you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your own.Take it or leave it. That\&#39;s just the kind of book it is.&#39;,
 &#34;Borinmg &amp; dumb: A waste of time.Glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world, and they don&#39;t.Don&#39;t bother, a nice tape to record over.And the last time I buy a film because Brandon Frazier is in it. Naked or not!&#34;,
 &#34;Best film of the year: One of the best films ever made, Gods and Monsters works on many levels. It presents the many roles men play -- gay/straight, husband/bachelor, parent/child, lover/monster, youth/elderly, whitecollar/bluecollar -- wrapped in a captivating story. Listen for the music; it&#39;s hauntingly beautiful.&#34;,
 &#39;See this movie just for Ian McKellen\&#39;s performance!: &#34;Gods and Monsters&#34; is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed &#34;Frankenstein&#34; and &#34;Bride of Frankenstein&#34;. The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellan in the lead. I thought it dragged in a few areas, but on the whole it was a great movie.&#39;,
 &#34;best screenplays have more stability: One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon&#39;s amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen&#39;s anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that.&#34;,
 &#34;Tree arrived bent and poorly packed: The manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed, and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption. I have no idea how this tree looked all put together since I had to repack it and send it back. Thankfully Amazon.com&#39;s return policy is generous and swift - they get five stars for service! In the meantime, it was a real tree for me again this year . . . I may try to go with an artificial one next year, but will not order one online again.&#34;,

PageRank Explained
PageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page’s value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. But, Google looks at considerably more than the sheer volume of votes, or links a page receives; for example, it also analyzes the page that casts the vote. Votes cast by pages that are themselves “important” weigh more heavily and help to make other pages “important.” Using these and other factors, Google provides its views on pages’ relative importance.
Of course, important pages mean nothing to you if they don’t match your query. So, Google combines PageRank with sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to your search. Google goes far beyond the number of times a term appears on a page and examines all dozens of aspects of the page’s content (and the content of the pages linking to it) to determine if it’s a good match for your query.</p>
<p>Keyword Planner Description (from Google Adwords page):
Keyword Planner is a free AdWords tool for new or experienced advertisers that’s like a workshop for building new Search Network campaigns or expanding existing ones. You can search for keyword and ad group ideas, see how a list of keywords might perform, and even create a new keyword list by multiplying several lists of keywords together. Keyword Planner can also help you choose competitive bids and budgets to use with your campaigns.
